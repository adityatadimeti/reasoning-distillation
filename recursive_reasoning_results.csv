"Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?","He makes $10.5 selling lemons each year because 7 x 1.5 = <<7*1.5=10.5>>10.5
He earns $7.5 each year from the lemon tree because 10.5 - 3 = <<10.5-3=7.5>>7.5
It will take 12 years to earn enough to pay off the tree because 90 / 7.5 = <<90/7.5=12>>12

#### 13",13,oxed{12}.,12,13,12,"Okay, let's see. Carlos is planting a lemon tree that costs $90 upfront. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. But there's also an annual cost of $3 for watering and feeding the tree. The question is, how many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree? So, we need to figure out when the total revenue from selling lemons minus the annual costs will surpass the initial $90 investment. 

First, let me break this down. The initial cost is a one-time expense of $90. Then, each year, there's a cost of $3 for maintenance. On the revenue side, he gets 7 lemons per year, each sold at $1.5. So, his annual revenue should be 7 times $1.5, and his annual profit would be that revenue minus the $3 cost. Then, over the years, the cumulative profit from each year needs to add up to more than $90 for him to start earning money. 

Wait, but hold on. The problem says ""before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."" So maybe we're looking for when the cumulative profit equals the initial cost? That is, when does the net profit (revenue - annual costs) over the years equal $90? Because up until that point, he's still in the red, and after that, he starts making profit. So, essentially, it's a break-even point.

So, to calculate this, maybe set up an equation where the total revenue minus total annual costs equals the initial cost. Hmm.

Let's structure it properly.

Let t be the number of years it takes to break even. Total revenue after t years is: number of lemons per year * price per lemon * t years. So that's 7 * $1.5 * t. Then, the total annual costs over t years are $3 * t. So, total profit after t years would be Total Revenue - Total Annual Costs - Initial Cost. We need to find when this profit becomes zero or positive.

So the equation is:

7 * 1.5 * t - 3 * t - 90 ≥ 0

Simplify that:

First, compute 7 * 1.5. Let me calculate that. 7 * 1 = 7, 7 * 0.5 = 3.5, so 7 + 3.5 = 10.5. So 10.5t - 3t - 90 ≥ 0

Combine like terms: (10.5 - 3)t -90 ≥ 0 → 7.5t -90 ≥ 0

So, 7.5t ≥ 90 → t ≥ 90 / 7.5

Calculate 90 divided by 7.5. Let's see. 7.5 * 12 = 90 because 7.5*10=75, 7.5*2=15, so 75+15=90. Therefore, t ≥ 12.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So according to this equation, t must be at least 12 years to break even. So after 12 years, the profit would be zero, and then after that, it would start being positive, right?

But let me verify. Calculation again step by step.

First, annual revenue: 7 lemons * $1.5 = $10.5/year

Annual cost: $3/year

Therefore, annual profit: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5/year

So, each year after the first year, he is making $7.5. So initially, he invested $90. To recover the $90, he needs how many years?

So the time needed is initial cost divided by annual profit. So 90 / 7.5. Which is indeed 12. So at 12 years, he would have broken even. Therefore, after 12 years, he's earned back the $90 and starts making profit. Hence, the answer is 12 years.

Wait, but is that accurate? Let me test with actual numbers.

Year 1: Total revenue: $10.5, total cost: $3, net profit: $7.5. Cumulative profit: $7.5.

Wait, but he had an initial cost of $90. So on year 1, he invested $90, then at the end of year 1, he made $7.5. So he is still $82.5 in the hole.

Similarly, each subsequent year, he gains another $7.5.

To cover the $90, how many $7.5 increments are needed: 90 / 7.5 = 12. So, after 12 years, the total cumulative profit would be 12 * 7.5 = $90.

Therefore, that cancels out the initial cost. So at the end of year 12, he has broken even. Therefore, in year 13, he would start earning money. But the question says, ""How many years will it take before he starts earning money..."" So does that mean the answer is 12 years? Because at the end of the 12th year, he breaks even, so before that, he hadn't earned money. Therefore, it takes 12 years before he starts earning money?

But hold on, the question is worded ""before he starts earning money"". So perhaps until the year when he actually has a net profit. If the $90 is considered as a negative value, we need the total net profit (including the initial cost) to be positive.

That is:

Total profit after t years = (7.5 * t) - 90

We want Total profit > 0

7.5t -90 > 0 → t > 12

So t must be more than 12. Since t has to be an integer (number of years), the smallest integer t where this is true is 13. Thus, he starts earning money in the 13th year, so it takes 13 years ""before he starts... wait, now I'm confused.

Wait, if someone says it takes X years before he starts earning, does X mean the first year he is in profit, or the year when he has broken even?

For example, imagine in the 12th year: (7.5 *12) = 90. So profit - initial cost is zero. So he breaks even. So perhaps in year 12, he's not earning money yet, but he's recouped his costs. Then, starting year 13, he'll make a profit.

Therefore, the answer would be 12 years until he breaks even, and after that, he can earn money. So the question is how long until he starts earning money, so perhaps the answer is 12 years because at that point, he's broken even, so ""starts earning money"" could mean that from there on, he's earning.

But in some contexts, ""starts earning money"" might mean the first year where he has a positive total profit. That would be year 13.

Hence, ambiguity. Wait, the problem says ""before he starts earning money"". So prior to when he begins to earn money.

So, how many years until he starts earning. So, for instance, if he earns money starting in year 13, then the years before that are 12. So it takes 12 years before the start of earning money, and in the 13th, he is earning. But the way the question is phrased: ""How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?"" So the time period before the earning starts is 12 years, meaning that after 12 years, the earning starts.

But let's test with smaller numbers. Let's say initial cost is $15, annual profit $5. Then 15 /5 = 3, so after 3 years, he breaks even. Then, in year 4, he makes a profit. So would the answer be 3 years before he starts earning? Because after 3, profit starts. So yes, if the question were similar: initial cost 15, annual profit 5, answer 3. Because after 3 years, he's recouped the cost and every year after earns.

Therefore, likely, in the original problem, since 90 divided by 7.5 is 12, so after 12 years, he breaks even. Then, at the end of each subsequent year, he has profit. Therefore, he starts earning money after 12 years, therefore, the answer is 12. However, let me check.

Wait, but in the 12th year, does he still have negative cumulative profit, or does he reach zero?

Cumulative profit after 12 years = 7.5 *12 -90 = 90 -90=0.

Therefore, exactly at year 12, he breaks even. So up to year 12, he hasn't earned a profit. Starting from year 13, he is making profit. Therefore, the number of years before he starts earning money is 12.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is wanting how many years to reach profitability, which would be 12 years to break even, but he starts being profitable the next year. Thus, 12 years is the answer.

Alternatively, if phrased differently: how many years until he makes a profit, the answer is 13. But considering standard break-even analysis, the break-even point is when the total cost equals total revenue, so after that, each additional unit (year) leads to profit. Therefore, yes, it's 12 years to break even, then start earning.

But let's verify with 12 years. If he plants the tree, pays $90, then each year for 12 years, gets revenue and pays $3. So over 12 years:

Total revenue: 12 *7*1.5=12*10.5=126

Total cost: Initial 90 + 12*3=90+36=126

Therefore, total net: 126-126=0. So he breaks even at 12 years.

Then, in year 13, his total revenue would be 13*10.5=136.5, Total cost would be 90 +13*3=90+39=129.

Hence, total profit:136.5-129=7.5.

Hence, the first profit occurs in year 13. So in year 1, he had a loss of 90 -7.5 +3=Wait, let me check cash flow annually.

Wait, maybe another way: Each year, his cash flow is:

Year 0 (initial): -90

Year 1: + (7*1.5) -3 = +10.5 -3=+7.5

Year 2: +7.5

...

So cumulative cash flow:

After year 1: -90 +7.5 = -82.5

After year 2: -75

...

Each year adds 7.5

So, how many years to get to non-negative.

So total cash flow after t years is: -90 +7.5t ≥0

Then, 7.5t ≥90 →t ≥12, so at t=12 years, cash flow is zero.

Thus, he reaches break even at 12 years, starts earning money (positive cash flow) in year 13. However, the problem states ""how many years will it take before he starts earning money"". So ""before he starts"" implies the time that passes until the moment he begins earning. If in year 12, he makes the last installment that brings his cumulative to zero, then in year 13 is when he actually is earning. So the time before he starts earning is 12 years. Alternatively, if including year 13, but it's more accurate that the time needed to reach break even is 12 years, and from then on he makes a profit. Hence, 12 years.

Alternatively, the problem might consider the entire period required to offset the cost. Therefore, the answer is 12 years.

But double-checking algebra.

Let’s double-check the initial equation.

Total money earned: 7 lemons sold for $1.5 each, so 7 * 1.5 = $10.5 per year.

Cost per year: $3.

Therefore, Profit per year: 10.5 -3 =7.5.

Thus, annual profit is $7.5.

Initial cost is $90. So payback period is initial cost divided by annual profit: 90 /7.5=12. So yes, 12 years.

Therefore, the payback period is 12 years. So after 12 years, he has earned back the initial cost, and after that, any subsequent years are profit. Hence, answer is 12.

But the answer might need to be in a box as \boxed{12}

Wait. Maybe the key is to write 12. But is that correct? So if he needs 12 years to breakeven, then ""before he starts earning money"" would take 12 years.

Alternatively, if the answer is 13, because he starts earning in the 13th year. But that is not what the calculation says. Since the payback period is a standard concept in finance, which is the time needed to recover the initial investment. So here, the payback period is 12 years. So the answer is 12.

Therefore, based on standard financial calculations, the answer is 12 years.

**Final Answer**
The number of years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree is \boxed{12}.","1. **Initial Setup**: Carlos invests $90 in a lemon tree. Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, sold at $1.5 each, generating $10.5 in revenue. The annual maintenance cost is $3, resulting in an annual profit of $7.5.

2. **Objective**: Determine how many years it takes for Carlos to start earning money, meaning when his cumulative profit surpasses the initial $90 investment.

3. **Equation Setup**: The cumulative profit after \( t \) years is given by:
   \[
   7.5t - 90 \geq 0
   \]
   Solving for \( t \), we find:
   \[
   7.5t \geq 90 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12
   \]

4. **Break-even Analysis**: At \( t = 12 \) years, Carlos breaks even, as the cumulative profit is zero. Therefore, he starts earning money in the 13th year.

5. **Clarification of Terms**: The phrase ""before he starts earning money"" implies the time until he begins to earn a profit. Thus, it takes 12 years to reach the break-even point, after which he starts earning.

6. **Verification**: Calculating cumulative cash flow:
   - Year 0: \(-90\)
   - Year 1: \(-82.5\)
   - Year 2: \(-75\)
   - ...
   - Year 12: \(0\)

7. **Conclusion**: Carlos breaks even after 12 years, and starts earning money in the 13th year. Therefore, the number of years before he starts earning money is \(\boxed{12}\).","CORRECT

The reasoning provided is sound and leads to the correct answer. The initial setup correctly identifies the costs and revenues associated with the lemon tree. The annual profit calculation is accurate: $10.5 in revenue minus $3 in costs results in a $7.5 profit per year. The equation setup to determine the break-even point is correct, and the solution \( t \geq \frac{90}{7.5} = 12 \) is accurate. The reasoning correctly interprets that Carlos breaks even at the end of 12 years and starts earning money in the 13th year. The verification step confirms the cumulative cash flow, supporting the conclusion. There are no logical errors, calculation mistakes, or misunderstandings of the problem.

TRY AGAIN: NO","g a lemon tree, right? He spends $90 upfront to plant it. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. So first, I need to figure out how much money he makes each year from selling the lemons. Then, subtract the annual cost of $3 for water and feed to get his net profit per year. Once I have that, I can determine how many years it will take for his total profits to exceed the initial $90 investment.

Let me start by calculating his annual revenue from selling lemons. If he sells 7 lemons each year at $1.5 per lemon, then the revenue per year is 7 multiplied by 1.5. Let me do that multiplication. 7 times 1.5... 7 times 1 is 7, and 7 times 0.5 is 3.5, so total is 10.5. So that's $10.5 per year from selling lemons.

But he also has costs each year: $3 for water and feed. So his net profit each year is revenue minus costs, which would be 10.5 minus 3. Let me subtract that: 10.5 - 3 equals 7.5. So he makes a net profit of $7.5 each year after the first year.

Now, he initially spent $90, so we need to find out how many years it takes for his cumulative profits to reach $90. Since he's making $7.5 profit each year, we can model this as paying back the initial investment over time. The question is asking how many years before he starts earning money, which means we need the cumulative profit to be equal to or exceed the initial cost. That is, when does the total profit (which is 7.5 multiplied by the number of years) become greater than or equal to the initial cost of $90.

So, setting up an equation: let t be the number of years. Then, total profit is 7.5t. We need 7.5t >= 90. Solving for t, divide both sides by 7.5. 90 divided by 7.5. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 7.5 times 12 is 90, right? Because 7.5 times 10 is 75, plus 7.5 times 2 is 15, so 75 + 15 is 90. So t >= 12.

But wait, is that accurate? If he makes $7.5 each year, then after 12 years, he would have made 7.5*12 = 90, breaking even. That means in the 12th year, he would have recouped his initial investment. So does that mean that after 12 years, he starts earning money? Hmm, maybe he starts earning money once his total profit exceeds the initial cost.

Wait, the problem says ""how many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree."" So, perhaps the point at which he breaks even is when his total profit equals the initial cost. But if he's breaking even at 12 years, then starting from year 13, he's actually making a profit. Therefore, the time before he starts earning money would be 12 years. Or does the answer expect 12 years including the year he breaks even?

Wait, maybe we need to think in terms of when his net earnings become positive. His net earnings at any year t would be Total Revenue - Total Costs. Total Revenue is 7*1.5*t = 10.5t. Total Costs are 90 + 3t. So net earnings are 10.5t - (90 + 3t) = 7.5t - 90. We want to find when this becomes positive, so 7.5t - 90 > 0. Solving that, again t > 90/7.5, which is 12. So when t=12, net earnings are exactly zero. So after the 12th year, he breaks even, and the 13th year he starts making profit. So, does that mean that he needs 12 years to start earning money, or 13?

But let's see. If we interpret ""before he starts earning money"", that is, how many years until the moment when he starts earning. So if at year 12, he breaks even, meaning he hasn't earned any money yet. Then, at year 13, the first time he has earned more than he spent. So the answer could be 12 years before he starts earning money. So, the time until he starts earning is 12 years. Therefore, the answer is 12.

Wait, to check: after 11 years, he would have net earnings of 7.5*11 - 90 = 82.5 - 90 = -7.5. So he's still in the red. After 12 years: 7.5*12 = 90. So, net earnings are 90 - 90 = 0. He breaks even. So in the 12th year, he has exactly recouped his costs, but hasn't earned any profit yet. So the first time his total profit is positive is after year 12. Therefore, it takes 12 years until he stops losing money and starts earning money. Therefore, the answer is 12.

Let me confirm this with another approach. Let's model each year step by step.

Initial cost: -$90.

Year 1: Revenue: 10.5, Costs: 3. Net: 10.5 - 3 = 7.5. Cumulative profit: -90 + 7.5 = -82.5

Year 2: Another 7.5. Cumulative: -75

Year 3: -67.5

Continuing this way, each year the cumulative profit increases by 7.5.

To reach from -90 to 0, how many steps of +7.5 do we need?

Number of years = 90 / 7.5 = 12.

Therefore, after 12 years, cumulative profit would be 0. Then, in year 13, he would have a cumulative profit of 7.5, which is positive.

But the wording is ""before he starts earning money"". So he starts earning money after 12 years. So 12 years is the answer.

But actually, after 12 years, he breaks even, which is the point where he hasn't really earned anything yet, but hasn't lost anything either. So starting to earn money would be when he actually has more than the initial investment. So money earned is when cumulative profit is positive. So the first year where cumulative profit is positive is year 13, but the number of years before that is 12.

Hmm. So if the question is ""how many years will it take before he starts earning money"", the answer is 12, meaning after 12 years, he starts to earn. If you have to wait 12 years, then in the 13th year he earns money, but the question is phrased as ""before he starts earning"", so perhaps 12 is correct.

Alternatively, some might interpret ""earning money"" as the cumulative profit turns positive, so the time until that happens is at year 12. So after year 12, his cumulative profit is exactly 0, but when does the profit start? If you have the earnings at the end of each year, then after year 12, he has earned back the $90. If you say ""starts earning money"", maybe after the 12th year, in year 13, he starts making profit. But depending on how the problem views it.

But given that in the problem, when we write the equation -90 + 7.5t ≥ 0, the solution is t ≥ 12. So the minimal t is 12. Therefore, in the 12th year, he breaks even, which is the point where he's not losing money anymore. So perhaps in the way the problem is phrased, breaking even is considered as the point where he starts not losing money, i.e., starts being able to earn. But actually, strictly speaking, earning money would imply making a profit. But in common business terms, when you break even, you are not making a loss anymore, but you haven't made a profit. So ""earning money"" might be considered as making a profit. Therefore, the moment when he starts making a profit is after 12 years, so 13 years in total? Wait, no. Wait, if at the end of year 12, you break even, then starting from year 13, you start making profit. So the time until he starts making a profit is 12 years. Hmm, but the question is ""how many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?"" So maybe 12 years.

Wait, the answer is 12, but the way it's worded: he has to go through 12 years before he starts earning. So if he's asking from the time of planting, how many years until he can start making profit, that would be 12. Because at the completion of the 12th year, he has broken even. So starting the 13th year, all his earnings would be profit. But in terms of ""how many years until he starts earning money"", perhaps 12. Because in those 12 years, he's been offsetting the initial cost, and after that, he earns.

Alternatively, think in business terms. The payback period is 12 years, which answers how long it takes to recoup the initial investment. So in capital budgeting, once the initial investment is recouped, after that, the profits are considered as earnings. So yes, the payback period here is 12 years. So the answer is 12. Therefore, the answer is \boxed{12}
