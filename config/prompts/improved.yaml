    PROBLEM:
    {question}

    PREVIOUS SOLUTION ATTEMPTS:
    {summaries}

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. First, identify key insights from each previous solution attempt (list at least 2-3 from each)
    2. Highlight which approaches contain promising elements and which contain potential errors
    3. ONLY THEN develop your solution by building upon the correct elements
    4. Present your final answer in \boxed{} format

    Your analysis of previous attempts is critical to finding the correct approach. Do not start solving from scratch without addressing the previous work."
