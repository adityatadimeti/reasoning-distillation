Please split the following reasoning chain of an LLM into
annotated parts using labels and the following format ["label
"]...["end-section"]. A sentence should be split into multiple
parts if it incorporates multiple behaviours indicated by the
labels.
Available labels:
0. initializing -> The model is rephrasing the given task and

1. deduction -> The model is performing a deduction step based on
its current approach and assumptions.
2. adding-knowledge -> The model is enriching the current approach
with recalled facts.
3. example-testing -> The model generates examples to test its
current approach.
4. uncertainty-estimation -> The model is stating its own
uncertainty.
5. backtracking -> The model decides to change its approach.
The reasoning chain to analyze:
{thinking_process}
Answer only with the annotated text. Only use the labels outlined
above. If there is a tail that has no annotation leave it out.
