pure_summarization:
  template: |
    Summarize the following attempted solution to a mathematical problem into a concise outline of the main steps.
    Focus only on compressing the key calculations and reasoning without adding any evaluation, analysis, or suggestions.
    
    Your summary should:
    1. Extract only the essential steps in the problem-solving process
    2. Maintain the same logical flow as the original solution
    3. Be significantly shorter than the original while preserving critical information
    
    PROBLEM:
    {question}

    ATTEMPTED SOLUTION:

    SUMMARY:

approach_focused_summarization:
  template: |
    Summarize the following attempted solution to an AIME math problem. Your summary should:
    
    1. Outline the complete solution strategy that was used (e.g., geometric approach, algebraic manipulation, etc.)
    2. Include all key equations, formulations, and transformations
    3. Highlight the critical assumptions made during the solution
    4. Note any complex calculations or numerical work
    5. Identify any points where the solution path branches or makes specific choices
    
    Create a comprehensive but concise summary that would allow someone to fully understand the approach that was taken, without needing to see the original work.

    Summarize the following attempted solution to an AIME math problem. Your summary should:
    
    1. Outline the complete solution strategy that was used (e.g., geometric approach, algebraic manipulation, etc.)
    2. Include all key equations, formulations, and transformations
    3. Highlight the critical assumptions made during the solution
    4. Evaluate whether the solution approach appears to be correct or may contain errors
    
    If you believe the solution may be incorrect:
    - Identify specific steps or calculations that might contain errors
    - Suggest 1-2 alternative solution approaches that could be more effective
    
    If you believe the solution appears correct:
    - Note what verification steps could be performed to confirm the answer
    - Highlight any simplifications or optimizations that could improve the solution

    SUMMARY:

aime_replay:
  template: |
    Produce a concise, chronological replay of the solver's thought process in the following attempted solution to the question.
    
    • Cover ALL major moves in the order they occurred - setup, logical deductions, recalled facts, numerical checks, “wait” moments, false starts, corrections, and final calculations.  
    • Do NOT rewrite the solution into a cleaner path; preserve the original flow, including any uncertainty, back-tracking, or revisions.  
    • Compress by fusing consecutive sentences that serve the same purpose, but never skip a step that changed the solver's state of mind.    
    • After the replay, show the solver's final answer in \boxed{}.
