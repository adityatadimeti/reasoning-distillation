    Summarize the following attempted solution to an AIME math problem. Your summary should:
    
    1. Outline the complete solution strategy that was used (e.g., geometric approach, algebraic manipulation, etc.)
    2. Include all key equations, formulations, and transformations
    3. Highlight the critical assumptions made during the solution
    4. Note any complex calculations or numerical work
    5. Identify any points where the solution path branches or makes specific choices
