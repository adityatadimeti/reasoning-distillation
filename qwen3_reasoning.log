To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

Instead, it evaluates to:\n\n- (42 + 43) = 85  \n- (92 / 4) = 23  \n- 85 - 23 = **62**  \n\n**Conclusion:** The attempted solution **is correct** and successfully achieves the target value of 62 using all numbers exactly once and valid operations.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**<answer> (42 + 43) - (92 / 4) </answer>**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all the numbers from the list [4, 42, 43, 92] exactly once, applying the allowed operations (addition, subtraction, division) and parentheses. It evaluates as follows:  \n- (42 + 43) = 85  \n- (92 / 4) = 23  \n- 85 - 23 = 62  \n\nThus, the equation correctly equals the target number **62** and satisfies all the given rules.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n<answer> (42 + 43) - (92 / 4) </answer>\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers from the list [4, 42, 43, 92] exactly once, applying allowed operations (+, -, /) and parentheses to control order of operations. It calculates (42 + 43) = 85 and (92 / 4) = 23, then subtracts to get 85 - 23 = 62, which matches the target.

It first explores forming **2** as a result of division, such as **24 / 12 = 2**.\n2. It attempts to construct **24** using **85 - 50 - 11** and **12** using **23 - 11**.\n3. However, this initial approach uses **11** twice, which is not allowed.\n4. The solution is then corrected by restructuring the expression to:\n   $$\n   ((85 - 50) - 11) / (23 - 11)\n   $$\n   This ensures **11** is used only once and all numbers are used exactly once.\n5. The final evaluation confirms:\n   - $ 85 - 50 = 35 $\n   - $ 35 - 11 = 24 $\n   - $ 23 - 11 = 12 $\n   - $ 24 / 12 = 2 $\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe solution successfully constructs the equation **((85 - 50) - 11) / (23 - 11)**, which evaluates to **2**, using each number exactly once.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

However, they were unable to generate **11** from the remaining numbers (41, 79, and 29) using valid operations.\n\nThey then tried various expressions like:\n\n- $\\frac{33}{(79 - 41 - 29)} = \\frac{33}{9} = 3.666...$\n- Subtracting or manipulating this result to reach exactly 3, but none of these attempts worked due to either incorrect results or reusing numbers.\n\nDespite extensive testing, the solution did not arrive at the correct expression that evaluates exactly to **3** using all four numbers **exactly once**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe attempted solution **did not find a valid expression** that satisfies all the constraints of the problem, specifically the requirement that the result must be exactly **3** using all the numbers **once** and only the allowed operations. The solver came close with expressions like $\\frac{33}{(79 - 41 - 29)} = \\frac{33}{9} = 3.666...$, but this does not equal **3**.\n\nThus, the **attempted solution was unsuccessful** in finding the correct answer.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

It applies multiplication and subtraction operations with parentheses to control the order of operations. However, the result of this equation does **not** equal 80, which is the target number. Therefore, the attempted solution is **incorrect**.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**(13 * 18) - 58 - 96**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all four numbers (13, 18, 58, 96) exactly once, as required. It applies multiplication and subtraction operations with parentheses to control the order of operations. However, the result of this equation is **(234) - 58 - 96 = 80**, which **does equal the target value of 80**. Therefore, the attempted solution is **correct** and satisfies all the given rules.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**(13 * 18) - 58 - 96**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis solution uses all the numbers from the list [96, 13, 58, 18] exactly once, as required. It applies multiplication and subtraction operations with parentheses to control the order of operations. However, the result of this equation is **(234) - 58 - 96 = 80**, which **does equal the target value of 80**. Therefore, this is a **valid solution** to the problem.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**(13 * 18) - 58 - 96**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers (13, 18, 58, 96) exactly once, and applies valid operations (multiplication and subtraction). However, it does **not** equal the target number **80**. Calculating the result:\n\n- 13 * 18 = 234  \n- 234 - 58 = 176  \n- 176 - 96 = 80  \n\nWait — **this actually does equal 80**!  \n\nSo the attempted solution **is correct** and satisfies all the rules. The equation **(13 * 18) - 58 - 96** correctly equals 80 using all numbers exactly once.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

However, they were unable to generate **11** from the remaining numbers (41, 79, and 29) using valid operations.\n\nThey then tried various expressions like:\n\n- $\\frac{33}{(79 - 41 - 29)} = \\frac{33}{9} = 3.666...$\n- Subtracting or manipulating this result to reach exactly 3, but none of these attempts worked due to either incorrect results or reusing numbers.\n\nDespite extensive testing, the solution did not arrive at the correct expression that evaluates exactly to **3** using all four numbers **exactly once**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe attempted solution **did not find a valid expression** that satisfies all the constraints of the problem, specifically the requirement that the result must be exactly **3** using all the numbers **once** and only the allowed operations. The solver came close with expressions like $\\frac{33}{(79 - 41 - 29)} = \\frac{33}{9} = 3.666...$, but this does not equal **3**.\n\nThus, the **attempted solution was unsuccessful** in finding the correct answer.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution repeatedly proposes the equation `(33 - 29) * (79 - 41) / 38 = 4`, which evaluates to `4 * 38 / 38 = 4`, but this does not equal the target value of 3. Another equation `(79 - 41 - 29) - (33 / 11)` evaluates to `9 - 3 = 6`, which is also incorrect. Additionally, an invalid solution involving division by zero is mentioned: `(33 - (79 - 41)) / (29 - 29)`, which is not permissible.\n\nDespite multiple iterations and attempts, the correct solution that satisfies all the rules (using all numbers exactly once, valid operations, and achieving a result of 3) is not clearly identified in the attempted solution. The problem guarantees that a valid solution exists, but the provided attempts have not successfully found it.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

However, they were unable to generate **11** from the remaining numbers (41, 79, and 29) using valid operations.\n\nThey then tried various expressions like:\n\n- $\\frac{33}{(79 - 41 - 29)} = \\frac{33}{9} = 3.666...$\n- Subtracting or manipulating this result to reach exactly 3, but none of these attempts worked due to either incorrect results or reusing numbers.\n\nDespite extensive testing, the solution did not arrive at the correct expression that evaluates exactly to **3** using all four numbers **exactly once**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe attempted solution **did not find a valid expression** that satisfies all the constraints of the problem, specifically the requirement that the result must be exactly **3** using all the numbers **once** and only the allowed operations. The solver came close with expressions like $\\frac{33}{(79 - 41 - 29)} = \\frac{33}{9} = 3.666...$, but this does not equal **3**.\n\nThus, the **attempted solution was unsuccessful** in finding the correct answer.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution repeatedly proposes the equation `(33 - 29) * (79 - 41) / 38 = 4`, which evaluates to `4 * 38 / 38 = 4`, but this does not equal the target value of 3. Another equation `(79 - 41 - 29) - (33 / 11)` evaluates to `9 - 3 = 6`, which is also incorrect. Additionally, an invalid solution involving division by zero is mentioned: `(33 - (79 - 41)) / (29 - 29)`, which is not permissible.\n\nDespite multiple iterations and attempts, the correct solution that satisfies all the rules (using all numbers exactly once, valid operations, and achieving a result of 3) is not clearly identified in the attempted solution. The problem guarantees that a valid solution exists, but the provided attempts have not successfully found it.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution explored multiple combinations of the numbers [41, 79, 33, 29] to reach the target value of 3. It tried expressions like (79 - 41 - 29) = 9 and 33 / 9, but this resulted in approximately 3.666, not 3. Other attempts, such as (33 - 29) * (79 - 41) and (33 - (79 - 41 - 29)), also failed to yield 3. Despite multiple trials and reevaluations, the correct equation was not found, and the solver concluded that they were unable to determine the solution at that time.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

The solution is correct and adheres to all the given rules.  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \n<answer> 21 + (63 / (26 - 17)) </answer>\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution uses the numbers 21, 63, 26, and 17 exactly once, following the rules. It constructs the equation **21 + (63 / (26 - 17))**, which simplifies as follows:\n\n- **26 - 17 = 9**\n- **63 / 9 = 7**\n- **21 + 7 = 28**\n\nThis correctly equals the target number **28**. Therefore, the attempted solution is valid and meets all the given requirements.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**21 + (63 / (26 - 17))**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers from the list [26, 17, 63, 21] exactly once, following the allowed operations and parentheses. It simplifies as follows:  \n- 26 - 17 = 9  \n- 63 / 9 = 7  \n- 21 + 7 = 28  \n\nThus, the equation correctly evaluates to **28**, satisfying the problem's requirements.  \nThe solution is valid and correct.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

However, they were unable to generate **11** from the remaining numbers (41, 79, and 29) using valid operations.\n\nThey then tried various expressions like:\n\n- $\\frac{33}{(79 - 41 - 29)} = \\frac{33}{9} = 3.666...$\n- Subtracting or manipulating this result to reach exactly 3, but none of these attempts worked due to either incorrect results or reusing numbers.\n\nDespite extensive testing, the solution did not arrive at the correct expression that evaluates exactly to **3** using all four numbers **exactly once**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe attempted solution **did not find a valid expression** that satisfies all the constraints of the problem, specifically the requirement that the result must be exactly **3** using all the numbers **once** and only the allowed operations. The solver came close with expressions like $\\frac{33}{(79 - 41 - 29)} = \\frac{33}{9} = 3.666...$, but this does not equal **3**.\n\nThus, the **attempted solution was unsuccessful** in finding the correct answer.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution repeatedly proposes the equation `(33 - 29) * (79 - 41) / 38 = 4`, which evaluates to `4 * 38 / 38 = 4`, but this does not equal the target value of 3. Another equation `(79 - 41 - 29) - (33 / 11)` evaluates to `9 - 3 = 6`, which is also incorrect. Additionally, an invalid solution involving division by zero is mentioned: `(33 - (79 - 41)) / (29 - 29)`, which is not permissible.\n\nDespite multiple iterations and attempts, the correct solution that satisfies all the rules (using all numbers exactly once, valid operations, and achieving a result of 3) is not clearly identified in the attempted solution. The problem guarantees that a valid solution exists, but the provided attempts have not successfully found it.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution explored multiple combinations of the numbers [41, 79, 33, 29] to reach the target value of 3. It tried expressions like (79 - 41 - 29) = 9 and 33 / 9, but this resulted in approximately 3.666, not 3. Other attempts, such as (33 - 29) * (79 - 41) and (33 - (79 - 41 - 29)), also failed to yield 3. Despite multiple trials and reevaluations, the correct equation was not found, and the solver concluded that they were unable to determine the solution at that time.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution repeatedly proposes the equation:\n\n<answer> (79 - 41 - 29) - (33 / 11) </answer>\n\nHowever, this equation is **not valid** under the given problem constraints because it uses the number **11**, which is **not part of the original input list** [41, 79, 33, 29]. The rules explicitly state that **only the numbers in the input list can be used**, and **each number must be used exactly once**.\n\nAdditionally, the solution attempts to derive 11 from the given numbers, but this is not possible using the allowed operations and without reusing or introducing numbers not in the original list.\n\nA valid solution must use **only the numbers 41, 79, 33, and 29**, and must **not introduce any other numbers**, such as 11.\n\nDespite multiple reiterations of the same invalid solution, the correct solution is **not provided** in the attempted solution. Therefore, the **attempted solution is incorrect** and does **not meet the problem's constraints**.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

It attempts to reach the target value of 85 by first adding 35 and 49, dividing the result by 21, and then subtracting that quotient from 89. However, the actual result of this equation is **89 - (84 / 21) = 89 - 4 = 85**, which **does** equal the target. Therefore, the attempted solution is **correct**.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**<answer> 89 - ((35 + 49) / 21) </answer>**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers from the list [89, 35, 49, 21] exactly once. It applies addition inside the parentheses (35 + 49 = 84), then divides the result by 21 (84 / 21 = 4), and finally subtracts that from 89 (89 - 4 = 85). The result is correct and satisfies the problem's requirements.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**<answer> 89 - ((35 + 49) / 21) </answer>**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers from the list [89, 35, 49, 21] exactly once. It applies addition inside the parentheses (35 + 49), then division by 21, and finally subtracts the result from 89. However, the actual result of this equation does **not** equal 85, which is the target number. Therefore, while the solution follows the rules of using all numbers once and applying valid operations, it **does not solve the problem correctly**.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**89 - ((35 + 49) / 21)**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers (89, 35, 49, 21) exactly once and applies valid operations (addition, division, and subtraction) with parentheses to control the order of operations. However, it does **not** evaluate to the target number **85**. Instead, it evaluates to:\n\n**((35 + 49) / 21) = 84 / 21 = 4**  \n**89 - 4 = 85** — **Wait, this *does* equal 85!**\n\nSo, the attempted solution **is actually correct** and satisfies all the problem's requirements. The final answer is valid.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

However, it does **not** equal the target number 74. Instead, it evaluates to:\n\n- 55 + 40 = 95  \n- 81 / 4 = 20.25  \n- 95 - 20.25 = **74.75**\n\nThus, the result is **74.75**, which is **not equal to 74**, making the attempted solution **incorrect**.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

The approach is to form **5** using **15, 17, and 42** so that **74 + 5 = 79**.\n\nIt calculates:\n\n$$\n(42 - 17 - 15) = 10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (17 - 15) = 2\n$$\n\nThen divides the two results to get **5**:\n\n$$\n\\frac{42 - 17 - 15}{17 - 15} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n$$\n\nFinally, it adds this result to **74**:\n\n$$\n74 + \\left( \\frac{42 - 17 - 15}{17 - 15} \\right) = 79\n$$\n\nThis expression uses all four numbers exactly once and evaluates correctly to the target.\n\n### Summary:\nThe solution constructs the value **5** using **15, 17, and 42** through subtraction and division, then adds it to **74** to reach the target **79**. The final expression is valid and follows all the rules.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**74 + ((42 - 17 - 15) / (17 - 15))**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation attempts to use all four numbers (74, 42, 17, 15) exactly once with allowed operations. However, it **reuses the number 17** in both the numerator and denominator of the fraction, which **violates the rule** that each number can only be used once. Therefore, the solution is **invalid** due to the repeated use of 17.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**74 + ((42 - 17 - 15) / (17 - 15))**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers from the list [74, 15, 17, 42], but **reuses the number 17** in both the numerator and denominator of the fraction. This violates the rule that **each number must be used exactly once**. Therefore, the attempted solution is **invalid** due to the repeated use of 17.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

However, it does **not** equal the target number 74. Instead, it evaluates to:\n\n- 55 + 40 = 95  \n- 81 / 4 = 20.25  \n- 95 - 20.25 = **74.75**\n\nThus, the result is **74.75**, which is **not equal to 74**, making the attempted solution **incorrect**.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution explored multiple combinations of the numbers [81, 40, 4, 55] with the operations +, -, *, and /, in an effort to construct an equation that evaluates to exactly **74**. While several expressions were tested, none of them evaluated to **74** exactly. The closest attempt was:\n\n$$\n(55 + 40) - \\left(\\frac{81}{4}\\right) = 95 - 20.25 = 74.75\n$$\n\nHowever, this result is not equal to 74, and no valid expression using all four numbers exactly once was found that evaluates to 74. Despite extensive testing and re-evaluation, the correct solution was not identified in the attempted solution.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

The approach is to form **5** using **15, 17, and 42** so that **74 + 5 = 79**.\n\nIt calculates:\n\n$$\n(42 - 17 - 15) = 10 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (17 - 15) = 2\n$$\n\nThen divides the two results to get **5**:\n\n$$\n\\frac{42 - 17 - 15}{17 - 15} = \\frac{10}{2} = 5\n$$\n\nFinally, it adds this result to **74**:\n\n$$\n74 + \\left( \\frac{42 - 17 - 15}{17 - 15} \\right) = 79\n$$\n\nThis expression uses all four numbers exactly once and evaluates correctly to the target.\n\n### Summary:\nThe solution constructs the value **5** using **15, 17, and 42** through subtraction and division, then adds it to **74** to reach the target **79**. The final expression is valid and follows all the rules.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**74 + ((42 - 17 - 15) / (17 - 15))**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation attempts to use all four numbers (74, 42, 17, 15) exactly once with allowed operations. However, it **reuses the number 17** in both the numerator and denominator of the fraction, which **violates the rule** that each number can only be used once. Therefore, the solution is **invalid** due to the repeated use of 17.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**74 + ((42 - 17 - 15) / (17 - 15))**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers from the list [74, 15, 17, 42], but **reuses the number 17** in both the numerator and denominator of the fraction. This violates the rule that **each number must be used exactly once**. Therefore, the attempted solution is **invalid** due to the repeated use of 17.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution aims to create an equation that equals **79** using the numbers **[74, 15, 17, 42]** exactly once with the allowed operations. It observes that **74** is very close to the target and proposes forming the number **5** from the remaining numbers **15, 17, and 42** using the expression:\n\n$$\n\\frac{42 - 15 - 17}{17 - 15} = 5\n$$\n\nThis is then added to **74** to reach **79**, resulting in the equation:\n\n$$\n74 + \\left( \\frac{42 - 15 - 17}{17 - 15} \\right)\n$$\n\nHowever, this solution **reuses the number 17** in both the numerator and denominator of the fraction, which **violates the rule** that each number must be used **exactly once**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the Attempted Solution:\n\nThe approach correctly identifies that **74 + 5 = 79**, and attempts to form **5** from the remaining numbers. However, it **incorrectly reuses the number 17**, thus **failing to comply with the problem's rules**. As a result, the proposed equation is **invalid**.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

However, it does **not** equal the target number 74. Instead, it evaluates to:\n\n- 55 + 40 = 95  \n- 81 / 4 = 20.25  \n- 95 - 20.25 = **74.75**\n\nThus, the result is **74.75**, which is **not equal to 74**, making the attempted solution **incorrect**.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution explored multiple combinations of the numbers [81, 40, 4, 55] with the operations +, -, *, and /, in an effort to construct an equation that evaluates to exactly **74**. While several expressions were tested, none of them evaluated to **74** exactly. The closest attempt was:\n\n$$\n(55 + 40) - \\left(\\frac{81}{4}\\right) = 95 - 20.25 = 74.75\n$$\n\nHowever, this result is not equal to 74, and no valid expression using all four numbers exactly once was found that evaluates to 74. Despite extensive testing and re-evaluation, the correct solution was not identified in the attempted solution.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution aims to use the numbers **[81, 40, 4, 55]** exactly once with the allowed operations to form an equation that evaluates to **74**. The solution explores various combinations, including:\n\n- $ (55 + 40) - (81 / 4) = 74.75 $\n- $ (55 + 40) - ((81 - 4) / 4) = 75.75 $\n\nThese attempts come very close to the target but do not yield **exactly 74**. Despite extensive testing, no valid expression is found that evaluates to **exactly 74** while satisfying the rules.\n\nHowever, the solution concludes that the only expression that uses all numbers exactly once and matches the structure of the problem is:\n\n$$\n(55 + 40) - (81 / 4)\n$$\n\nEven though it evaluates to **74.75**, the solution claims this must be the intended answer, given the problem's guarantee of a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe attempted solution tries multiple expressions to reach 74 using the numbers [81, 40, 4, 55] with allowed operations. While no valid expression equals **exactly 74**, the closest and only expression that uses all numbers once is:\n\n$$\n(55 + 40) - (81 / 4)\n$$\n\nThis is submitted as the answer, even though it evaluates to **74.75**, possibly due to a computational or logical oversight.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

However, it does **not** equal the target number 74. Instead, it evaluates to:\n\n- 55 + 40 = 95  \n- 81 / 4 = 20.25  \n- 95 - 20.25 = **74.75**\n\nThus, the result is **74.75**, which is **not equal to 74**, making the attempted solution **incorrect**.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution explored multiple combinations of the numbers [81, 40, 4, 55] with the operations +, -, *, and /, in an effort to construct an equation that evaluates to exactly **74**. While several expressions were tested, none of them evaluated to **74** exactly. The closest attempt was:\n\n$$\n(55 + 40) - \\left(\\frac{81}{4}\\right) = 95 - 20.25 = 74.75\n$$\n\nHowever, this result is not equal to 74, and no valid expression using all four numbers exactly once was found that evaluates to 74. Despite extensive testing and re-evaluation, the correct solution was not identified in the attempted solution.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution aims to use the numbers **[81, 40, 4, 55]** exactly once with the allowed operations to form an equation that evaluates to **74**. The solution explores various combinations, including:\n\n- $ (55 + 40) - (81 / 4) = 74.75 $\n- $ (55 + 40) - ((81 - 4) / 4) = 75.75 $\n\nThese attempts come very close to the target but do not yield **exactly 74**. Despite extensive testing, no valid expression is found that evaluates to **exactly 74** while satisfying the rules.\n\nHowever, the solution concludes that the only expression that uses all numbers exactly once and matches the structure of the problem is:\n\n$$\n(55 + 40) - (81 / 4)\n$$\n\nEven though it evaluates to **74.75**, the solution claims this must be the intended answer, given the problem's guarantee of a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe attempted solution tries multiple expressions to reach 74 using the numbers [81, 40, 4, 55] with allowed operations. While no valid expression equals **exactly 74**, the closest and only expression that uses all numbers once is:\n\n$$\n(55 + 40) - (81 / 4)\n$$\n\nThis is submitted as the answer, even though it evaluates to **74.75**, possibly due to a computational or logical oversight.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**(55 + 40) - (81 / 4)**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis solution uses all the numbers from the list [81, 40, 4, 55], each exactly once, and applies valid operations (+, -, /) with parentheses to control order. However, it does **not** equal the target value of 74. The calculation evaluates to:  \n(55 + 40) = 95  \n(81 / 4) = 20.25  \n95 - 20.25 = **74.75**, which is **not equal to 74**.  \n\nThus, while the solution follows the rules, it does **not** achieve the desired result.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

It attempts to reach the target value of 75 by first multiplying 18 and 46, dividing the result by 69, and then subtracting that from 87. However, it does not confirm whether this expression actually evaluates to 75, which would be required to solve the problem correctly.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**<answer> 87 - (18 * 46) / 69 </answer>**  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers from the list [69, 87, 18, 46], each exactly once, and applies the allowed operations (multiplication, division, subtraction). It uses parentheses to control the order of operations. The calculation proceeds as follows:  \n1. Multiply 18 by 46: $18 \\times 46 = 828$  \n2. Divide the result by 69: $828 / 69 = 12$  \n3.

Therefore, the attempted solution is **correct** and satisfies all the problem's rules.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution is:  \n<answer> 38 - (72 / 4) + 17 </answer>\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all four numbers (38, 72, 4, and 17) exactly once, applying division, subtraction, and addition with parentheses to control the order of operations. However, it does **not** evaluate to the target number 37. Instead, it evaluates to:  \n38 - (72 / 4) + 17 = 38 - 18 + 17 = 37.  \n\n**Note:** This solution **does** actually equal 37 and follows all the rules. Therefore, it is a **valid** and **correct** solution to the problem.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution is:  \n<answer> 38 - (72 / 4) + 17 </answer>\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution attempts to use all four numbers (72, 17, 4, 38) with operations and parentheses. It computes 72 divided by 4 (resulting in 18), subtracts that from 38 (resulting in 20), and then adds 17 (resulting in 37). This correctly uses all numbers once and applies valid operations to reach the target of 37. The equation is mathematically correct and adheres to the rules.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

It identified that **45 ÷ (79 - 64) = 3**, which gives the desired result using three of the numbers.\n2. It then struggled with incorporating the remaining number **4** without violating the rule of using each number only once.\n3. It proposed using **(4 ÷ 4) = 1** to include the number 4, but this would require **two 4s**, which is not allowed.\n4. Despite this contradiction, the solution proceeded to use **(45 ÷ (79 - 64)) × (4 ÷ 4)**, which evaluates to **3**, but **incorrectly uses 4 twice**.\n\n### Summary:\nThe attempted solution **incorrectly assumes** that using **(4 ÷ 4)** is valid, even though it **violates the rule of using each number only once**. While the expression **(45 ÷ (79 - 64))** correctly evaluates to 3, the inclusion of **4** in **(4 ÷ 4)** leads to a **repetition of 4**, making the solution **invalid** under the problem's constraints.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

However, evaluating the expression:\n\n- **26 * 2 = 52**\n- **79 - 30 = 49**\n- **52 - 49 = 3**\n\nThe result is **3**, which matches the target value. Therefore, the attempted solution is **correct** and satisfies all the given rules.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**(26 * 2) - (79 - 30)**.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all four numbers from the list [26, 30, 2, 79] exactly once and applies valid operations (+, -, *, /) with parentheses to control order. It simplifies as follows:\n\n- 26 * 2 = 52  \n- 79 - 30 = 49  \n- 52 - 49 = 3  \n\n**Result:** The equation evaluates to **3**, which matches the target value.  \n**Conclusion:** The attempted solution is **correct** and satisfies all the problem's constraints.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

It identified that **45 ÷ (79 - 64) = 3**, which gives the desired result using three of the numbers.\n2. It then struggled with incorporating the remaining number **4** without violating the rule of using each number only once.\n3. It proposed using **(4 ÷ 4) = 1** to include the number 4, but this would require **two 4s**, which is not allowed.\n4. Despite this contradiction, the solution proceeded to use **(45 ÷ (79 - 64)) × (4 ÷ 4)**, which evaluates to **3**, but **incorrectly uses 4 twice**.\n\n### Summary:\nThe attempted solution **incorrectly assumes** that using **(4 ÷ 4)** is valid, even though it **violates the rule of using each number only once**. While the expression **(45 ÷ (79 - 64))** correctly evaluates to 3, the inclusion of **4** in **(4 ÷ 4)** leads to a **repetition of 4**, making the solution **invalid** under the problem's constraints.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**<answer> (45 / (79 - 64)) * (4 / 4) </answer>**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all four numbers (79, 64, 45, and 4) exactly once. It calculates **(79 - 64) = 15**, then divides **45 / 15 = 3**. It then calculates **(4 / 4) = 1**, and multiplies **3 * 1 = 3**, which matches the target value. However, the equation includes an extra operation **(4 / 4)** that is not necessary to reach the target and may be considered redundant or overly complex. While it is mathematically valid, it does not use the numbers in the most direct or minimal way.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

It identified that **45 ÷ (79 - 64) = 3**, which gives the desired result using three of the numbers.\n2. It then struggled with incorporating the remaining number **4** without violating the rule of using each number only once.\n3. It proposed using **(4 ÷ 4) = 1** to include the number 4, but this would require **two 4s**, which is not allowed.\n4. Despite this contradiction, the solution proceeded to use **(45 ÷ (79 - 64)) × (4 ÷ 4)**, which evaluates to **3**, but **incorrectly uses 4 twice**.\n\n### Summary:\nThe attempted solution **incorrectly assumes** that using **(4 ÷ 4)** is valid, even though it **violates the rule of using each number only once**. While the expression **(45 ÷ (79 - 64))** correctly evaluates to 3, the inclusion of **4** in **(4 ÷ 4)** leads to a **repetition of 4**, making the solution **invalid** under the problem's constraints.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**<answer> (45 / (79 - 64)) * (4 / 4) </answer>**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all four numbers (79, 64, 45, and 4) exactly once. It calculates **(79 - 64) = 15**, then divides **45 / 15 = 3**. It then calculates **(4 / 4) = 1**, and multiplies **3 * 1 = 3**, which matches the target value. However, the equation includes an extra operation **(4 / 4)** that is not necessary to reach the target and may be considered redundant or overly complex. While it is mathematically valid, it does not use the numbers in the most direct or minimal way.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**<answer> (45 / (79 - 64)) * (4 / 4) </answer>**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all four numbers (79, 64, 45, 4) exactly once, as required. It calculates **(79 - 64) = 15**, then divides **45 / 15 = 3**, and multiplies it by **(4 / 4) = 1**, resulting in **3 * 1 = 3**, which matches the target. The equation is valid and follows all the rules.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

It identified that **45 ÷ (79 - 64) = 3**, which gives the desired result using three of the numbers.\n2. It then struggled with incorporating the remaining number **4** without violating the rule of using each number only once.\n3. It proposed using **(4 ÷ 4) = 1** to include the number 4, but this would require **two 4s**, which is not allowed.\n4. Despite this contradiction, the solution proceeded to use **(45 ÷ (79 - 64)) × (4 ÷ 4)**, which evaluates to **3**, but **incorrectly uses 4 twice**.\n\n### Summary:\nThe attempted solution **incorrectly assumes** that using **(4 ÷ 4)** is valid, even though it **violates the rule of using each number only once**. While the expression **(45 ÷ (79 - 64))** correctly evaluates to 3, the inclusion of **4** in **(4 ÷ 4)** leads to a **repetition of 4**, making the solution **invalid** under the problem's constraints.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**<answer> (45 / (79 - 64)) * (4 / 4) </answer>**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all four numbers (79, 64, 45, and 4) exactly once. It calculates **(79 - 64) = 15**, then divides **45 / 15 = 3**. It then calculates **(4 / 4) = 1**, and multiplies **3 * 1 = 3**, which matches the target value. However, the equation includes an extra operation **(4 / 4)** that is not necessary to reach the target and may be considered redundant or overly complex. While it is mathematically valid, it does not use the numbers in the most direct or minimal way.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**<answer> (45 / (79 - 64)) * (4 / 4) </answer>**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all four numbers (79, 64, 45, 4) exactly once, as required. It calculates **(79 - 64) = 15**, then divides **45 / 15 = 3**, and multiplies it by **(4 / 4) = 1**, resulting in **3 * 1 = 3**, which matches the target. The equation is valid and follows all the rules.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**<answer> (45 / (79 - 64)) * (4 / 4) </answer>**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all the required numbers (79, 64, 45, and 4) exactly once. It calculates **(79 - 64) = 15**, then divides **45 by 15** to get **3**. It then divides **4 by 4** to get **1**, and multiplies **3 * 1 = 3**, which matches the target value. However, this solution is **invalid** because it uses the number **4 twice** (once in **45 / (79 - 64)** and again in **(4 / 4)**), violating the rule that each number must be used exactly once.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

The key insight is recognizing that **33 / 3 = 11**, and then using **76 - 59 = 17** to form a fraction **17 / 17 = 1**, which when added to **11** gives **12**. The final equation is:\n\n$$\n<answer> (33 / 3) + ((76 - 59) / (76 - 59)) </answer>\n$$\n\n**Summary:** The solution uses division and subtraction to form **11** and **1**, then adds them to get **12**, using all numbers exactly once.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution aimed to create an equation using all the numbers **[59, 76, 33, 3]** exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to reach the target value **12**. \n\nThe solution explored several combinations, including:\n\n- Using **33 / 3 = 11** as a step toward 12.\n- Trying to derive **1** from the remaining numbers (59 and 76), but this led to reusing numbers, which is invalid.\n- Testing various expressions like **(33 - 3) - (76 - 59)** and **(33 / 3) + (76 - 59) - (76 - 59)**, but these either reused numbers or did not evaluate to 12.\n\nDespite multiple attempts, the solution repeatedly returned to an invalid expression that reused **76** and **59**.\n\n### Summary:\nThe attempted solution explored multiple valid expressions using all four numbers, but none of them correctly evaluated to **12** without reusing numbers. The solution repeatedly tried the expression **(33 / 3) + (76 - 59) - (76 - 59)**, which equals **12**, but it is invalid due to reusing **76** and **59**. The correct and valid solution that satisfies all the rules and evaluates to **12** was not successfully found in the attempted solution.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

The key insight is recognizing that **33 / 3 = 11**, and then using **76 - 59 = 17** to form a fraction **17 / 17 = 1**, which when added to **11** gives **12**. The final equation is:\n\n$$\n<answer> (33 / 3) + ((76 - 59) / (76 - 59)) </answer>\n$$\n\n**Summary:** The solution uses division and subtraction to form **11** and **1**, then adds them to get **12**, using all numbers exactly once.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution aimed to create an equation using all the numbers **[59, 76, 33, 3]** exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to reach the target value **12**. \n\nThe solution explored several combinations, including:\n\n- Using **33 / 3 = 11** as a step toward 12.\n- Trying to derive **1** from the remaining numbers (59 and 76), but this led to reusing numbers, which is invalid.\n- Testing various expressions like **(33 - 3) - (76 - 59)** and **(33 / 3) + (76 - 59) - (76 - 59)**, but these either reused numbers or did not evaluate to 12.\n\nDespite multiple attempts, the solution repeatedly returned to an invalid expression that reused **76** and **59**.\n\n### Summary:\nThe attempted solution explored multiple valid expressions using all four numbers, but none of them correctly evaluated to **12** without reusing numbers. The solution repeatedly tried the expression **(33 / 3) + (76 - 59) - (76 - 59)**, which equals **12**, but it is invalid due to reusing **76** and **59**. The correct and valid solution that satisfies all the rules and evaluates to **12** was not successfully found in the attempted solution.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**(33 / 3) + ((76 - 59) / (76 - 59))**.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all the required numbers (33, 3, 76, 59) exactly once. It computes **33 / 3 = 11**, and then evaluates **(76 - 59) / (76 - 59) = 17 / 17 = 1**. Adding these gives **11 + 1 = 12**, which matches the target. However, the expression **(76 - 59) / (76 - 59)** involves division by the same expression twice, which may be considered redundant or unnecessarily complex. Despite this, the solution is mathematically valid and satisfies the problem constraints.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

The key insight is recognizing that **33 / 3 = 11**, and then using **76 - 59 = 17** to form a fraction **17 / 17 = 1**, which when added to **11** gives **12**. The final equation is:\n\n$$\n<answer> (33 / 3) + ((76 - 59) / (76 - 59)) </answer>\n$$\n\n**Summary:** The solution uses division and subtraction to form **11** and **1**, then adds them to get **12**, using all numbers exactly once.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution aimed to create an equation using all the numbers **[59, 76, 33, 3]** exactly once with basic arithmetic operations to reach the target value **12**. \n\nThe solution explored several combinations, including:\n\n- Using **33 / 3 = 11** as a step toward 12.\n- Trying to derive **1** from the remaining numbers (59 and 76), but this led to reusing numbers, which is invalid.\n- Testing various expressions like **(33 - 3) - (76 - 59)** and **(33 / 3) + (76 - 59) - (76 - 59)**, but these either reused numbers or did not evaluate to 12.\n\nDespite multiple attempts, the solution repeatedly returned to an invalid expression that reused **76** and **59**.\n\n### Summary:\nThe attempted solution explored multiple valid expressions using all four numbers, but none of them correctly evaluated to **12** without reusing numbers. The solution repeatedly tried the expression **(33 / 3) + (76 - 59) - (76 - 59)**, which equals **12**, but it is invalid due to reusing **76** and **59**. The correct and valid solution that satisfies all the rules and evaluates to **12** was not successfully found in the attempted solution.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**(33 / 3) + ((76 - 59) / (76 - 59))**.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe solution uses all the required numbers (33, 3, 76, 59) exactly once. It computes **33 / 3 = 11**, and then evaluates **(76 - 59) / (76 - 59) = 17 / 17 = 1**. Adding these gives **11 + 1 = 12**, which matches the target. However, the expression **(76 - 59) / (76 - 59)** involves division by the same expression twice, which may be considered redundant or unnecessarily complex. Despite this, the solution is mathematically valid and satisfies the problem constraints.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**(33 / 3) + (76 - 59) - (76 - 59)**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all the numbers [59, 76, 33, 3] exactly once. However, it is **not valid** because the expression **(76 - 59)** is used twice, which violates the rule that each number can only be used once. Additionally, the result of the equation simplifies to **11 + 17 - 17 = 11**, which does **not** equal the target of **12**. Therefore, the attempted solution is incorrect both in terms of number usage and the final result.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

It breaks the problem into steps by forming intermediate values:\n\n1. Calculates **(63 - 56) = 7** and **(37 - 13) = 24**, then multiplies them to get **168**.\n2. Attempts to divide 168 by **14** to reach **12**, and tries to form **14** using **56 ÷ 4**.\n3. Then attempts to form **4** from the remaining numbers using a complex nested expression:  \n   **37 - (63 - (56 - (63 - 37))) = 4**.\n4. Combines all parts into a final expression:\n   $$\n   ((63 - 56) * (37 - 13)) / (56 / (37 - (63 - (56 - (63 - 37)))))\n   $$\n\nHowever, this expression is overly complex and may not simplify cleanly to **12** due to the nested operations and potential reuse of numbers. While the structure follows the rules, the validity of the solution is questionable and likely incorrect.\n\n**Summary**: The solution attempts to use nested operations to form intermediate values and combines them in a complex expression to reach 12. However, the approach is unnecessarily complicated and may not correctly satisfy the problem constraints or produce the correct result.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

It breaks the problem into steps by forming intermediate values:\n\n1. Calculates **(63 - 56) = 7** and **(37 - 13) = 24**, then multiplies them to get **168**.\n2. Attempts to divide 168 by **14** to reach **12**, and tries to form **14** using **56 ÷ 4**.\n3. Then attempts to form **4** from the remaining numbers using a complex nested expression:  \n   **37 - (63 - (56 - (63 - 37))) = 4**.\n4. Combines all parts into a final expression:\n   $$\n   ((63 - 56) * (37 - 13)) / (56 / (37 - (63 - (56 - (63 - 37)))))\n   $$\n\nHowever, this expression is overly complex and may not simplify cleanly to **12** due to the nested operations and potential reuse of numbers. While the structure follows the rules, the validity of the solution is questionable and likely incorrect.\n\n**Summary**: The solution attempts to use nested operations to form intermediate values and combines them in a complex expression to reach 12. However, the approach is unnecessarily complicated and may not correctly satisfy the problem constraints or produce the correct result.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution tries to use all four numbers (13, 56, 37, 63) with a complex arrangement of operations and parentheses to reach the target value of 12. However, the expression is overly convoluted and likely incorrect due to its nested structure, which may result in division by zero or incorrect evaluation. The solution does not clearly simplify to 12 and appears to violate the intended simplicity and correctness of the problem's constraints. It fails to provide a valid, simplified equation that equals 12 using the given numbers and operations.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

Subtracting **59** from **86** to get **27**.\n2. Dividing **38** by **14** to get approximately **2.714**.\n3. Subtracting the result of step 2 from the result of step 1 to get **24.2857**, which is close but not exactly **24**.\n\nThe author then proposes the expression:\n\n$$\n(86 - 59) - (38 / 14)\n$$\n\nas the solution, claiming it uses all four numbers exactly once and is valid under the rules.\n\nHowever, this expression evaluates to **24.2857**, not exactly **24**, and therefore does **not** satisfy the problem's requirement of producing the exact target value.\n\n**Summary of the attempted solution:**\nThe solution attempts to use subtraction and division to reduce the large numbers to the target of 24, but the final expression evaluates to approximately 24.2857, not the exact value of 24. The approach is creative but does not yield the correct result.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

Subtracting the result of step 2 from the result of step 1 to get **24.2857**, which is close but not exactly **24**.\n\nThe author then proposes the expression:\n\n$$\n(86 - 59) - (38 / 14)\n$$\n\nas the solution, claiming it uses all four numbers exactly once and is valid under the rules.\n\nHowever, this expression evaluates to **24.2857**, not exactly **24**, and therefore does **not** satisfy the problem's requirement of producing the exact target value.\n\n**Summary of the attempted solution:**\nThe solution attempts to use subtraction and division to reduce the large numbers to the target of 24, but the final expression evaluates to approximately 24.2857, not the exact value of 24.

However, the result of this equation does **not** equal 24. Instead, it evaluates to approximately **24.714**, which does not meet the target value of 24. Thus, while the solution follows the rules, it does **not** solve the problem correctly.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

Subtracting the result of step 2 from the result of step 1 to get **24.2857**, which is close but not exactly **24**.\n\nThe author then proposes the expression:\n\n$$\n(86 - 59) - (38 / 14)\n$$\n\nas the solution, claiming it uses all four numbers exactly once and is valid under the rules.\n\nHowever, this expression evaluates to **24.2857**, not exactly **24**, and therefore does **not** satisfy the problem's requirement of producing the exact target value.\n\n**Summary of the attempted solution:**\nThe solution attempts to use subtraction and division to reduce the large numbers to the target of 24, but the final expression evaluates to approximately 24.2857, not the exact value of 24. The approach is creative but does not yield the correct result.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**(86 - 59) - (38 / 14)**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers from the list [86, 38, 14, 59], each exactly once, and applies valid operations (subtraction and division) with parentheses to control order. However, the result of this equation does **not** equal 24. Instead, it evaluates to approximately **24.714**, which does not meet the target value of 24. Thus, while the solution follows the rules, it does **not** solve the problem correctly.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation `((38 - 14) * (86 - 59)) / (86 - 59)`. However, this equation is invalid because it uses the numbers 86 and 59 **twice**, violating the rule that each number must be used exactly once. Additionally, the expression simplifies to `(24 * 27) / 27 = 24`, which would technically yield the correct result, but the reuse of numbers makes the solution incorrect under the given constraints.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

Subtracting **59** from **86** to get **27**.\n2. Dividing **38** by **14** to get approximately **2.714**.\n3. Subtracting the result of step 2 from the result of step 1 to get **24.2857**, which is close but not exactly **24**.\n\nThe author then proposes the expression:\n\n$$\n(86 - 59) - (38 / 14)\n$$\n\nas the solution, claiming it uses all four numbers exactly once and is valid under the rules.\n\nHowever, this expression evaluates to **24.2857**, not exactly **24**, and therefore does **not** satisfy the problem's requirement of producing the exact target value.\n\n**Summary of the attempted solution:**\nThe solution attempts to use subtraction and division to reduce the large numbers to the target of 24, but the final expression evaluates to approximately 24.2857, not the exact value of 24. The approach is creative but does not yield the correct result.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n**(86 - 59) - (38 / 14)**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis equation uses all four numbers from the list [86, 38, 14, 59], each exactly once, and applies valid operations (subtraction and division) with parentheses to control order. However, the result of this equation does **not** equal 24. Instead, it evaluates to approximately **24.714**, which does not meet the target value of 24. Thus, while the solution follows the rules, it does **not** solve the problem correctly.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation `((38 - 14) * (86 - 59)) / (86 - 59)`. However, this equation is invalid because it uses the numbers 86 and 59 **twice**, violating the rule that each number must be used exactly once. Additionally, the expression simplifies to `(24 * 27) / 27 = 24`, which would technically yield the correct result, but the reuse of numbers makes the solution incorrect under the given constraints.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution proposes the equation:  \n`(38 - 14) * (86 - 59) / (86 - 59)`.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis solution uses all four numbers (38, 14, 86, 59) exactly once, and applies valid operations and parentheses. However, it simplifies to `(24) * (27) / (27) = 24`, which technically equals 24, but it **reuses the expression (86 - 59)**, which is not allowed under the rules (each number can only be used once). Therefore, the solution is **invalid** due to reuse of the number 86 and 59 in the same operation.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=25000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.
