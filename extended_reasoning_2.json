  "question": "Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. Carlos is planting a lemon tree that costs $90 upfront. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. But there's also a yearly cost of $3 for water and feed. He wants to know how many years it will take before he starts earning money on the tree. Hmm, so we need to figure out when his total earnings from the lemons will exceed the initial cost plus the yearly expenses.\n\nFirst, I should break down the costs and revenues each year. The initial cost is $90, right? Then, every year, he has to spend $3 on maintenance. At the same time, each year the tree produces 7 lemons, which he sells at $1.5 each. So, the revenue from the lemons each year would be 7 times $1.5. Let me calculate that: 7 * 1.5 = $10.5. So each year, he makes $10.5 from selling lemons and spends $3 on upkeep. Therefore, his net profit each year is 10.5 - 3 = $7.5.\n\nSo, every year after the first year, he's making a net profit of $7.5. But he also had that initial $90 investment. So, he needs to recover the $90 before he can start earning money overall. This is like a payback period problem in finance, where you calculate how long it takes for the cash inflows to cover the initial outflow.\n\nWait, but hold on, does the first year's profit happen right after planting, or does he have to wait a year? Since the tree is planted, I assume that in the first year, it starts growing and produces lemons that year. So, the first year's revenue would be $10.5, and expense $3, so net $7.5. Then each subsequent year is the same. But the initial cost is upfront, so that's at time zero.\n\nSo, his total cost is $90, and each year he gets $7.5. To find out when the cumulative $7.5 per year exceeds $90, we can set up an equation. Let's let Y be the number of years. Then, total profit after Y years is 7.5 * Y, and we need this to be greater than or equal to 90.\n\nSo, 7.5Y \u2265 90. Solving for Y, we divide both sides by 7.5: Y \u2265 90 / 7.5. Let me calculate that. 90 divided by 7.5. Hmm, 7.5 times 12 is 90, right? Because 7.5*10=75, 7.5*2=15, so 75+15=90. So Y \u2265 12. Therefore, it takes 12 years for the cumulative profit to equal the initial cost. So, after 12 years, he breaks even, and then in the 13th year, he starts making a profit. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"how many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\" So, does that mean when he breaks even or when he actually has a positive net gain overall?\n\nIf breaking even is when he starts earning money, then it's 12 years. But if starting to earn money is after breaking even, then it would be 12 years to break even, and then he starts earning from the 13th year onward. The question is a bit ambiguous. Let me check again.\n\n\"How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\" So, perhaps they mean the time until the net profit becomes positive, which would be when cumulative revenues exceed cumulative costs. So, initial cost is $90. Each year, he spends $3 and gains $10.5. So, the net each year is +$7.5. So, the cumulative net profit after Y years is -90 + 7.5Y. We need to find the smallest Y where -90 + 7.5Y \u2265 0.\n\nYes, that's a better way to model it. Because the initial cost is a one-time expense, and each year he has a net profit of $7.5. So, total profit is -90 + 7.5Y. We set this greater than or equal to zero: -90 +7.5Y \u2265 0 \u2192 7.5Y \u2265 90 \u2192 Y \u2265 12. So, after 12 years, he breaks even. Therefore, he starts earning money after 12 years. So, it takes 12 years before he starts earning money.\n\nBut the wording is a bit tricky. If someone says \"it will take X years beforeFor example, after 11 years, cumulative profit would be 7.5*11 = 82.5. So, 82.5 -90 = -7.5. So, he's still $7.5 in the red. After 12 years, it's 7.5*12 = 90. 90 -90 = 0. So, he breaks even. So, he hasn't earned money yet, he just recovers his costs. So, in year 13, he would have a cumulative profit of 7.5*13 -90 = 97.5 -90 = 7.5. So, $7.5 profit. Therefore, he starts earning money in the 13th year. But the question is asking how many years will it take before he starts earning money. So, does that mean the time until he has positive profit, which is 12 years? Because after 12 years, he breaks even, but he starts earning money after that. So, the time before he starts earning money would be 12 years.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be 12 years if breaking even is considered as starting to earn money. But in strict terms, earning money would mean making a profit, which would be after recovering the initial investment. So, perhaps the answer is 12 years, since that's when he breaks even, and any year after that is profit. But maybe the question expects 12 as the answer. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's model the problem step by step each year. Let's keep track of the net profit each year.\n\nYear 0: He spends $90. Total profit: -$90.\n\nYear 1: Revenue $10.5, cost $3, net +$7.5. Total profit: -90 +7.5= -82.5.\n\nYear 2: Another $7.5. Total: -75.\n\nYear 3: -67.5.\n\nYear 4: -60.\n\nYear 5: -52.5.\n\nYear 6: -45.\n\nYear 7: -37.5.\n\nYear 8: -30.\n\nYear 9: -22.5.\n\nYear 10: -15.\n\nYear 11: -7.5.\n\nYear 12: 0.\n\nYear 13: +7.5.\n\nSo, after 12 years, he breaks even, so at the end of year 12, he has exactly recovered his costs. So, starting in year 13, he's making a profit. But the question is \"how many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\" So, it's the time until he is about to start earning, which is at year 12, but he starts earning money in year 13. So, the number of years before he starts earning is 12. Because during the 12th year, he breaks even, so after 12 years, he can start earning. So, the answer is 12.\n\nAlternatively, some might interpret \"starts earning money\" as when he actually has a positive net income, which would be after 12 years, meaning 13 years. But since the question is phrased as \"how many years will it take before he starts earning money\", I think it's asking how many years until the point where he begins to earn, so 12 years. At the 12-year mark, he has broken even, so from that point onward, he's earning. Therefore, it took 12 years before he starts earning money.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 12 years. So, \\boxed{12} is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\nThe problem is about when Carlos starts earning money, which is when his total revenue exceeds his total costs. The initial cost is $90, and each year he has a net profit of $7.5. The equation is:\n\nTotal Profit = -90 + 7.5Y\n\nWe set this equal to zero to find the breakeven point:\n\n-90 + 7.5Y = 0  \n7.5Y = 90  \nY = 90 / 7.5  \nY = 12\n\nSo, after 12 years, the total profit is zero, meaning he has recovered his initial investment and yearly costs. Starting from year 13, any profit he makes is actual earnings. Therefore, it takes 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.\n\n\\boxed{12}\nCarlos has an initial cost of $90. Each year, he incurs a cost of $3 and gains revenue from selling 7 lemons at $1.5 each, which gives $10.5. The net profit per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.\n\nTo find when he starts earning money, we need to determine when his cumulative net profit covers the initial $90. This can be modeled by the equation:\n\\[ -90 + 7.5Y \\geq 0 \\]\nSolving for \\( Y \\):\n\\[ 7.5Y \\geq 90 \\]\n\\[ Y \\geq \\frac{90}{7.5} \\]\n\\[ Y \\geq 12 \\]\n\nThus, after 12 years, the cumulative net profit is zero, meaning he has broken even. Starting from the 13th year, he will begin to make a profit. Therefore, it takes 12 years before he starts earning money.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\nAlright, let's tackle Carlos's lemon tree problem again. So, he spends $90 upfront to plant the tree. Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons that he can sell for $1.50 each. That gives him a revenue of 7 * $1.50 = $10.50 per year. But he also has annual costs of $3 for water and feed. So, his net profit each year is $10.50 - $3 = $7.50. \n\nThe question is, how many years will it take for Carlos to start earning money on this lemon tree? In other words, when will his cumulative profits exceed his initial investment of $90?\n\nLet's think of it step by step. Each year, he makes $7.50. To cover the $90 initial cost, we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 7.5y \\geq 90 \\]\nWhere \\( y \\) is the number of years. Dividing both sides by 7.5 gives:\n\\[ y \\geq \\frac{90}{7.5} \\]\nCalculating that, we get:\n\\[ y \\geq 12 \\]\nSo, after 12 years, the total profit from the lemon tree will be \\( 7.5 * 12 = 90 \\), which exactly covers the initial cost. This means that after 12 years, Carlos breaks even. Starting from the 13th year, any profit he makes will be actual earnings since the initial cost has already been recovered.\n\nTherefore, it takes 12 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\nOkay, let's model his cash flow step by step for each year. \n\n- **Year 0**: Initial cost of $90. Total profit: -$90.\n- **Year 1**: Net profit of $7.50. Total profit: -$90 + $7.50 = -$82.50\n- **Year 2**: Another $7.50. Total profit: -$82.50 + $7.50 = -$75\n- **Year 3**: -$75 + $7.50 = -$67.50\n- **Year 4**: -$60\n- **Year 5**: -$52.50\n- **Year 6**: -$45\n- **Year 7**: -$37.50\n- **Year 8**: -$30\n- **Year 9**: -$22.50\n- **Year 10**: -$15\n- **Year 11**: -$7.50\n- **Year 12**: -$7.50 + $7.50 = $0\n\nBy the end of the 12th year, Carlos has recovered his initial investment and ongoing costs, resulting in a total profit of $0. Starting from the 13th year, his total profit becomes positive. Therefore, it takes 12 years before he starts earning money.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{12}\n",
