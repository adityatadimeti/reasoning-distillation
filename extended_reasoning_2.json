  "question": "Carlos is planting a lemon tree. The tree will cost $90 to plant. Each year it will grow 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each. It costs $3 a year to water and feed the tree. How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. Carlos wants to plant a lemon tree that costs $90. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons which he can sell for $1.5 each. But he also has to spend $3 each year to take care of the tree. He wants to know how many years it will take before he starts earning money, so when his total earnings surpass the initial cost and the ongoing expenses. Hmm, right. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the initial cost is $90. That's a one-time expense. Then every year, he has expenses and income. Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons. If he sells each lemon for $1.50, then his yearly income from lemons would be 7 times $1.50. Let me calculate that: 7 * 1.5. 7*1 is 7, 7*0.5 is 3.5, so total is 10.5. So he makes $10.50 each year from selling lemons.\n\nBut then there's the cost of maintaining the tree, which is $3 per year. So his net profit each year would be his income minus the expense. That's $10.50 - $3.00 = $7.50 per year. So he makes a profit of $7.50 each year after the first year.\n\nWait, but the $90 is the initial cost. So he needs to recoup that $90 through his yearly profits. So, how long will it take for his cumulative profits to exceed the initial investment?\n\nSo, this is like a break-even analysis. The formula for break-even time when you have an initial cost and recurring profit is:\n\nBreak-even time (in years) = Initial Cost / Annual Profit\n\nBut here, the annual profit is $7.50. So let's compute that: $90 / $7.50. Let me calculate that. $90 divided by $7.50. Hmm, 7.50 times 12 is 90 because 7.50 * 10 = 75, plus 7.50 * 2 = 15, so 75 + 15 = 90. So, 7.50 * 12 = 90. Therefore, $90 divided by $7.50 is 12. So, does that mean 12 years?\n\nWait a second, but each year's profit is $7.50. So after 12 years, he would have made 12 * 7.50 = $90, which exactly covers the initial cost. So does that mean at 12 years he breaks even, and then after that, he starts making profit? But the question is, \"how many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\"\n\nSo if after 12 years, he has exactly recouped his initial investment, then in the 13th year, he would start earning money, right? Or does it mean that at the point when his cumulative profits exceed the initial cost, which would be after 12 years, but since after 12 years he's exactly even, that's the break-even point. So technically, he starts earning money after 12 years. Hmm, but maybe we need to check whether the profits are accounted at the end of each year.\n\nAssuming he plants the tree at year 0, pays $90, then each subsequent year, he gets the profit of $7.50. So at the end of year 1, he has a net profit of -90 + 7.50 = -82.50. End of year 2: -82.50 + 7.50 = -75.00. Continuing this way, each year his net profit increases by $7.50. So, after n years, his total net profit is -90 + 7.50*n.\n\nWe need to find the smallest n where -90 + 7.50*n >= 0.\n\nSo solving for n:\n\n7.50n >= 90\n\nn >= 90 / 7.50\n\nn >= 12\n\nSo n = 12 years. At the end of the 12th year, his total profit is exactly 0. So he breaks even. Therefore, he starts earning money in the 13th year? Or does breaking even count as starting to earn money? The problem says \"before he starts earning money\". So maybe the answer is 12 years because after 12 years, he has recouped his costs, so starting from year 13, he is earning profit. Therefore, the time before he starts earning money is 12 years.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let's break it down year by year.\n\nYear 0: Cost $90. Total profit: -$90.\n\nYear 1: Revenue $10\n\nLet me double-check this calculation.\nWait, 7 lemons sold at $1.5 each: 7 * 1.5. 1.5 is the same as 3/2, so 7*(3/2) = 21/2 = 10.5. So $10.50 revenue. Then subtract $3 expense, so net profit is $7.50.\n\nTherefore, each year, net profit is $7.50.\n\nSo in year 1: total profit = -90 +7.50 = -82.50\n\nYear 2: -82.50 +7.50= -75.00\n\nWait, so each year, total profit increases by $7.50.\n\nSo after 12 years: 12 *7.50=90.\n\nSo total profit would be -90 +90=0.\n\nTherefore, after 12 years, he breaks even.\n\nSo in the 12th year, he just breaks even. So to start earning money, he needs to have a positive profit. Therefore, that would be in the 13th year. So the time before he starts earning money is 12 years, and in the 13th year, he starts earning.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\" So the answer might be 12 years, meaning that after 12 years, he has covered his costs, and starts earning from that point. Or, depending on interpretation, maybe 12 years is the time needed to break even, so he starts earning money after 12 years. But the exact answer is when cumulative profit is positive. Let's verify:\n\nAt the end of year 12, his total is 0. Therefore, in year 13, he would add another $7.50, making total profit $7.50. So he starts earning money in the 13th year. Therefore, it takes 12 years before he starts earning, meaning that during the 12th year he breaks even, and in the following years, he starts earning. Therefore, the answer is 12 years.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking after how many years will his total profit be positive, then it's 12 years. Because after 12 years, he has exactly broken even, so the next year (year 13) he is in profit. But the wording is \"before he starts earning money\". So the time before he starts is 12 years. So the answer is 12.\n\nBut let me check with the exact calculation:\n\nTotal profit after n years: -90 +7.50n.\n\nWe want the smallest integer n where -90 +7.50n >0.\n\nSolving:\n\n7.50n >90\n\nn > 90/7.50\n\nn >12\n\nSince n must be an integer (number of years), the smallest integer greater than 12 is 13. Therefore, it takes 13 years for the total profit to be positive. But this contradicts the previous conclusion.\n\nWait, hold on, let's resolve this discrepancy.\n\nIf after 12 years, total profit is zero. So at the end of the 12th year, he's broken even. So the first year he actually has a positive profit is the 13th year. Therefore, the answer should be 13 years. But depending on how the question is phrased.\n\nThe question is: \"How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\"\n\nIf \"starts earning money\" means the first year where he has a positive net income, that would be the first year. But no, because the first year he still has a net loss because of the initial cost. Wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the initial cost is $90. Then each year, he has a net profit of $7.50. So total profit over time is cumulative.\n\nSo, the total profit after n years is: -90 +7.50n.\n\nSo to find when this becomes positive:\n\n7.50n >90\n\nn>12.\n\nSo n=13.\n\nBut that means that after 13 years, the total profit is positive. Therefore, it takes 13 years before he starts earning money. Hmm, but this seems conflicting with the previous thought. Wait, let's think step by step.\n\nAt time 0: he pays $90.\n\nEnd of Year 1: he gets $7.50 profit. Total profit: -90 +7.50 = -82.50\n\nEnd of Year 2: another $7.50. Total: -75.00\n\n...\n\nEnd of Year 12: 12*7.50=90. So total profit: -90 +90=0.\n\nEnd of Year 13: 13*7.50=97.50. Total profit: -\n\nLet me double-check this calculation.\nWait, no. Each year, he makes $7.50 profit. So cumulative profit after n years is (7.50*n) -90.\n\nTherefore, at n=12: 7.50*12=90. 90-90=0.\n\nAt n=13:7.50*13=97.50. 97.50-90=7.50. So he has a positive profit.\n\nTherefore, he starts earning money at year 13. But the question is \"how many years will it take before he starts earning money\". So the time before starting to earn money is 12 years, and in the 13th year, he starts earning. Therefore, the answer is 12 years? Or is it 13?\n\nThis is ambiguous. If someone says \"it will take X years before he starts earning\", does X include the year in which he starts earning, or is it the years before that?\n\nFor example, if something happens in year 13, the time before it happens is 12 years. So, if you start counting from year 0, then 12 years later is the end of year 12. At that point, he's broken even. Then in the 13th year, he starts earning. So to get to the point where he starts earning, it takes 12 years, and then in the 13th, he has profit. Therefore, the answer is 12 years.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer as 12 because 90/7.5=12. So depending on how the question is interpreted.\n\nAlternatively, if you model it as the net present value, but since there's no interest rate given, we can ignore the time value of money. So the problem is purely about cumulative profit.\n\nBut let's see the exact question again: \"How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\"\n\nIf \"starts earning money\" means the first year where his net income is positive, then each year, his net income is $7.50 (after the first year). Wait, but wait, the first year he has the initial cost.\n\nWait, hold on, is the $90 initial cost considered as a Year 0 expense, and the revenues and expenses start in Year 1? If so, then:\n\nYear 0: -$90\n\nYear 1: +$7.50 (total -82.50)\n\nYear 2: +$7.50 (total -75.00)\n\n...\n\nYear 12: +$7.50 (total 0)\n\nYear 13: +$7.50 (total +7.50)\n\nTherefore, at the end of Year 12, his total is 0. So he breaks even after 12 years. Then, starting in Year 13, his total becomes positive. Therefore, he starts earning money in Year 13. Therefore, it takes 12 years before he starts earning money. So the answer is 12.\n\nBut if someone says, \"how many years does it take to start earning\", they might mean the number of full years needed before the earnings turn positive, which would be 12. Because in the 12th year, he reaches breakeven, so after 12 years, he can start earning. So 12 years is the answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check other possible interpretations. Suppose Carlos has to wait until the tree is planted and starts producing. The problem says \"each year it will grow 7 lemons\", so presumably starting from Year 1. So each year after planting, he gets lemons. So if he plants the tree now (Year 0), then in Year 1, he gets 7 lemons, sells them, subtracts the $3 cost, and has a net of $7.50. So each subsequent year.\n\nBut the problem is that the $90 is a sunk cost at planting. So the total profit is calculated as total revenues minus total costs. Total costs are $90 + $3 per year. Total revenues are $10.50 per year.\n\nSo, profit after n years is:\n\nTotal Revenue: 10.50*n\n\nTotal Cost: 90 +3*n\n\nProfit: 10.50n - (90 +3n) =7.50n -90\n\nWe want the smallest n where 7.50n -90 >0\n\nSo 7.50n >90 => n>12.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n=13. So after 13 years, the profit is positive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 13 years. But this contradicts previous conclusion.\n\nWait, now I am confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nIf you model the profit as (10.50 -3)*n -90=7.50n -90\n\nSo, solving 7.\n\nLet me double-check this calculation.\nSo, if Carlos plants the tree at Year 0, paying $90. Then, each year (including Year 1, Year 2, etc.), he spends $3 and gains $10.50. So the net cash flow each year is $7.50, starting from Year 1.\n\nTherefore, the total profit after n years is: -90 +7.50n\n\nWe set -90 +7.50n >0\n\n7.50n >90\n\nn>12\n\nThus, n=13 is the smallest integer where profit is positive. Therefore, it takes 13 years.\n\nBut then, why did I previously think it's 12? Perhaps a miscalculation.\n\nWait, if n=12:\n\nProfit = -90 +7.50*12= -90 +90=0\n\nSo at n=12, profit is zero. So he breaks even after 12 years, and after 13 years, profit is positive.\n\nSo the answer should be 13 years.\n\nBut that contradicts the initial thought. So which is correct?\n\nThe key here is the interpretation of the question. \"How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\"\n\nIf \"starts earning money\" is when the cumulative profit becomes positive, then it's 13 years. Because after 12 years, he's at zero, after 13 years, he's at +7.50. Therefore, the answer is 13.\n\nBut maybe the question is asking when does he start making a profit, i.e., in the year when his net income is positive. But each year, his net income is $7.50 (from Year 1 onwards). However, the first year, even though he has a net income of $7.50, he still has the initial cost of $90. Therefore, his total profit is negative until he recovers the initial cost.\n\nSo, it's possible that the question is considering \"earning money\" as having cumulative profit, not just annual profit. Since even though each year after planting he has a positive cash flow of $7.50, his overall profit is still negative until he recovers the $90.\n\nTherefore, he starts earning money (i.e., having cumulative profit) after 13 years. Because in the 13th year, his cumulative profit becomes positive.\n\nBut the problem might be considering \"starts earning money\" as when the annual profit exceeds the initial cost? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, \"starts earning money\" as in when the tree begins generating revenue. But then, that would be Year 1, but he still has the cost.\n\nAlternatively, the question is ambiguous, but based on the problem's context, it's more likely asking for when cumulative profit turns positive, which would be after 12 years of operation (Year 13). Therefore, the answer is 12 or 13?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem didn't consider the initial cost as part of the \"earning money\", but in reality, the initial cost is a sunk cost, and once he starts generating positive annual profit, he is earning money. However, that interpretation is unlikely, because the problem mentions the tree costs $90 to plant, so the $90 is part of the investment.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 12 years if we consider that after 12 years, he has broken even, and thus can start earning money from there on. But in reality, to have a positive net worth, it's 13 years. Therefore, the correct answer depends on the interpretation.\n\nLet's check similar problems. For example, if you have an initial cost and yearly profit, break-even is when total profits equal total costs. So, if someone asks \"how long until he starts making money\", the answer is the break-even point, which is 12 years. After that, each additional year is profit. So in the 12th year, he breaks even, so starting from the 13th year, he makes money. But the time taken before he starts is 12 years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer 12, as 90 divided by 7.5 is 12, which gives the exact number of years needed to recoup the initial cost. So maybe the answer is 12.\n\nHowever, in reality, you need to have the total profits exceed the initial cost. Since after 12 years, total profit equals initial cost, so the net is zero. So in that case, he hasn't earned money yet. So the first year he actually earns money is the 13th year.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 13.\n\nBut let's verify with exact cash flows:\n\nYear 0: -90\n\nYear 1: +7.50, total -82.50\n\nYear 2: +7.50, total -75.00\n\n...\n\nYear 12",
  "full_reasoning_with_tags": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Carlos wants to plant a lemon tree that costs $90. Each year, the tree grows 7 lemons which he can sell for $1.5 each. But he also has to spend $3 each year to take care of the tree. He wants to know how many years it will take before he starts earning money, so when his total earnings surpass the initial cost and the ongoing expenses. Hmm, right. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the initial cost is $90. That's a one-time expense. Then every year, he has expenses and income. Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons. If he sells each lemon for $1.50, then his yearly income from lemons would be 7 times $1.50. Let me calculate that: 7 * 1.5. 7*1 is 7, 7*0.5 is 3.5, so total is 10.5. So he makes $10.50 each year from selling lemons.\n\nBut then there's the cost of maintaining the tree, which is $3 per year. So his net profit each year would be his income minus the expense. That's $10.50 - $3.00 = $7.50 per year. So he makes a profit of $7.50 each year after the first year.\n\nWait, but the $90 is the initial cost. So he needs to recoup that $90 through his yearly profits. So, how long will it take for his cumulative profits to exceed the initial investment?\n\nSo, this is like a break-even analysis. The formula for break-even time when you have an initial cost and recurring profit is:\n\nBreak-even time (in years) = Initial Cost / Annual Profit\n\nBut here, the annual profit is $7.50. So let's compute that: $90 / $7.50. Let me calculate that. $90 divided by $7.50. Hmm, 7.50 times 12 is 90 because 7.50 * 10 = 75, plus 7.50 * 2 = 15, so 75 + 15 = 90. So, 7.50 * 12 = 90. Therefore, $90 divided by $7.50 is 12. So, does that mean 12 years?\n\nWait a second, but each year's profit is $7.50. So after 12 years, he would have made 12 * 7.50 = $90, which exactly covers the initial cost. So does that mean at 12 years he breaks even, and then after that, he starts making profit? But the question is, \"how many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\"\n\nSo if after 12 years, he has exactly recouped his initial investment, then in the 13th year, he would start earning money, right? Or does it mean that at the point when his cumulative profits exceed the initial cost, which would be after 12 years, but since after 12 years he's exactly even, that's the break-even point. So technically, he starts earning money after 12 years. Hmm, but maybe we need to check whether the profits are accounted at the end of each year.\n\nAssuming he plants the tree at year 0, pays $90, then each subsequent year, he gets the profit of $7.50. So at the end of year 1, he has a net profit of -90 + 7.50 = -82.50. End of year 2: -82.50 + 7.50 = -75.00. Continuing this way, each year his net profit increases by $7.50. So, after n years, his total net profit is -90 + 7.50*n.\n\nWe need to find the smallest n where -90 + 7.50*n >= 0.\n\nSo solving for n:\n\n7.50n >= 90\n\nn >= 90 / 7.50\n\nn >= 12\n\nSo n = 12 years. At the end of the 12th year, his total profit is exactly 0. So he breaks even. Therefore, he starts earning money in the 13th year? Or does breaking even count as starting to earn money? The problem says \"before he starts earning money\". So maybe the answer is 12 years because after 12 years, he has recouped his costs, so starting from year 13, he is earning profit. Therefore, the time before he starts earning money is 12 years.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let's break it down year by year.\n\nYear 0: Cost $90. Total profit: -$90.\n\nYear 1: Revenue $10\n\nLet me double-check this calculation.\nWait, 7 lemons sold at $1.5 each: 7 * 1.5. 1.5 is the same as 3/2, so 7*(3/2) = 21/2 = 10.5. So $10.50 revenue. Then subtract $3 expense, so net profit is $7.50.\n\nTherefore, each year, net profit is $7.50.\n\nSo in year 1: total profit = -90 +7.50 = -82.50\n\nYear 2: -82.50 +7.50= -75.00\n\nWait, so each year, total profit increases by $7.50.\n\nSo after 12 years: 12 *7.50=90.\n\nSo total profit would be -90 +90=0.\n\nTherefore, after 12 years, he breaks even.\n\nSo in the 12th year, he just breaks even. So to start earning money, he needs to have a positive profit. Therefore, that would be in the 13th year. So the time before he starts earning money is 12 years, and in the 13th year, he starts earning.\n\nBut the question is phrased as \"how many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\" So the answer might be 12 years, meaning that after 12 years, he has covered his costs, and starts earning from that point. Or, depending on interpretation, maybe 12 years is the time needed to break even, so he starts earning money after 12 years. But the exact answer is when cumulative profit is positive. Let's verify:\n\nAt the end of year 12, his total is 0. Therefore, in year 13, he would add another $7.50, making total profit $7.50. So he starts earning money in the 13th year. Therefore, it takes 12 years before he starts earning, meaning that during the 12th year he breaks even, and in the following years, he starts earning. Therefore, the answer is 12 years.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is asking after how many years will his total profit be positive, then it's 12 years. Because after 12 years, he has exactly broken even, so the next year (year 13) he is in profit. But the wording is \"before he starts earning money\". So the time before he starts is 12 years. So the answer is 12.\n\nBut let me check with the exact calculation:\n\nTotal profit after n years: -90 +7.50n.\n\nWe want the smallest integer n where -90 +7.50n >0.\n\nSolving:\n\n7.50n >90\n\nn > 90/7.50\n\nn >12\n\nSince n must be an integer (number of years), the smallest integer greater than 12 is 13. Therefore, it takes 13 years for the total profit to be positive. But this contradicts the previous conclusion.\n\nWait, hold on, let's resolve this discrepancy.\n\nIf after 12 years, total profit is zero. So at the end of the 12th year, he's broken even. So the first year he actually has a positive profit is the 13th year. Therefore, the answer should be 13 years. But depending on how the question is phrased.\n\nThe question is: \"How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\"\n\nIf \"starts earning money\" means the first year where he has a positive net income, that would be the first year. But no, because the first year he still has a net loss because of the initial cost. Wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, the initial cost is $90. Then each year, he has a net profit of $7.50. So total profit over time is cumulative.\n\nSo, the total profit after n years is: -90 +7.50n.\n\nSo to find when this becomes positive:\n\n7.50n >90\n\nn>12.\n\nSo n=13.\n\nBut that means that after 13 years, the total profit is positive. Therefore, it takes 13 years before he starts earning money. Hmm, but this seems conflicting with the previous thought. Wait, let's think step by step.\n\nAt time 0: he pays $90.\n\nEnd of Year 1: he gets $7.50 profit. Total profit: -90 +7.50 = -82.50\n\nEnd of Year 2: another $7.50. Total: -75.00\n\n...\n\nEnd of Year 12: 12*7.50=90. So total profit: -90 +90=0.\n\nEnd of Year 13: 13*7.50=97.50. Total profit: -\n\nLet me double-check this calculation.\nWait, no. Each year, he makes $7.50 profit. So cumulative profit after n years is (7.50*n) -90.\n\nTherefore, at n=12: 7.50*12=90. 90-90=0.\n\nAt n=13:7.50*13=97.50. 97.50-90=7.50. So he has a positive profit.\n\nTherefore, he starts earning money at year 13. But the question is \"how many years will it take before he starts earning money\". So the time before starting to earn money is 12 years, and in the 13th year, he starts earning. Therefore, the answer is 12 years? Or is it 13?\n\nThis is ambiguous. If someone says \"it will take X years before he starts earning\", does X include the year in which he starts earning, or is it the years before that?\n\nFor example, if something happens in year 13, the time before it happens is 12 years. So, if you start counting from year 0, then 12 years later is the end of year 12. At that point, he's broken even. Then in the 13th year, he starts earning. So to get to the point where he starts earning, it takes 12 years, and then in the 13th, he has profit. Therefore, the answer is 12 years.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer as 12 because 90/7.5=12. So depending on how the question is interpreted.\n\nAlternatively, if you model it as the net present value, but since there's no interest rate given, we can ignore the time value of money. So the problem is purely about cumulative profit.\n\nBut let's see the exact question again: \"How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\"\n\nIf \"starts earning money\" means the first year where his net income is positive, then each year, his net income is $7.50 (after the first year). Wait, but wait, the first year he has the initial cost.\n\nWait, hold on, is the $90 initial cost considered as a Year 0 expense, and the revenues and expenses start in Year 1? If so, then:\n\nYear 0: -$90\n\nYear 1: +$7.50 (total -82.50)\n\nYear 2: +$7.50 (total -75.00)\n\n...\n\nYear 12: +$7.50 (total 0)\n\nYear 13: +$7.50 (total +7.50)\n\nTherefore, at the end of Year 12, his total is 0. So he breaks even after 12 years. Then, starting in Year 13, his total becomes positive. Therefore, he starts earning money in Year 13. Therefore, it takes 12 years before he starts earning money. So the answer is 12.\n\nBut if someone says, \"how many years does it take to start earning\", they might mean the number of full years needed before the earnings turn positive, which would be 12. Because in the 12th year, he reaches breakeven, so after 12 years, he can start earning. So 12 years is the answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check other possible interpretations. Suppose Carlos has to wait until the tree is planted and starts producing. The problem says \"each year it will grow 7 lemons\", so presumably starting from Year 1. So each year after planting, he gets lemons. So if he plants the tree now (Year 0), then in Year 1, he gets 7 lemons, sells them, subtracts the $3 cost, and has a net of $7.50. So each subsequent year.\n\nBut the problem is that the $90 is a sunk cost at planting. So the total profit is calculated as total revenues minus total costs. Total costs are $90 + $3 per year. Total revenues are $10.50 per year.\n\nSo, profit after n years is:\n\nTotal Revenue: 10.50*n\n\nTotal Cost: 90 +3*n\n\nProfit: 10.50n - (90 +3n) =7.50n -90\n\nWe want the smallest n where 7.50n -90 >0\n\nSo 7.50n >90 => n>12.\n\nSince n must be an integer, n=13. So after 13 years, the profit is positive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 13 years. But this contradicts previous conclusion.\n\nWait, now I am confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nIf you model the profit as (10.50 -3)*n -90=7.50n -90\n\nSo, solving 7.\n\nLet me double-check this calculation.\nSo, if Carlos plants the tree at Year 0, paying $90. Then, each year (including Year 1, Year 2, etc.), he spends $3 and gains $10.50. So the net cash flow each year is $7.50, starting from Year 1.\n\nTherefore, the total profit after n years is: -90 +7.50n\n\nWe set -90 +7.50n >0\n\n7.50n >90\n\nn>12\n\nThus, n=13 is the smallest integer where profit is positive. Therefore, it takes 13 years.\n\nBut then, why did I previously think it's 12? Perhaps a miscalculation.\n\nWait, if n=12:\n\nProfit = -90 +7.50*12= -90 +90=0\n\nSo at n=12, profit is zero. So he breaks even after 12 years, and after 13 years, profit is positive.\n\nSo the answer should be 13 years.\n\nBut that contradicts the initial thought. So which is correct?\n\nThe key here is the interpretation of the question. \"How many years will it take before he starts earning money on the lemon tree?\"\n\nIf \"starts earning money\" is when the cumulative profit becomes positive, then it's 13 years. Because after 12 years, he's at zero, after 13 years, he's at +7.50. Therefore, the answer is 13.\n\nBut maybe the question is asking when does he start making a profit, i.e., in the year when his net income is positive. But each year, his net income is $7.50 (from Year 1 onwards). However, the first year, even though he has a net income of $7.50, he still has the initial cost of $90. Therefore, his total profit is negative until he recovers the initial cost.\n\nSo, it's possible that the question is considering \"earning money\" as having cumulative profit, not just annual profit. Since even though each year after planting he has a positive cash flow of $7.50, his overall profit is still negative until he recovers the $90.\n\nTherefore, he starts earning money (i.e., having cumulative profit) after 13 years. Because in the 13th year, his cumulative profit becomes positive.\n\nBut the problem might be considering \"starts earning money\" as when the annual profit exceeds the initial cost? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, \"starts earning money\" as in when the tree begins generating revenue. But then, that would be Year 1, but he still has the cost.\n\nAlternatively, the question is ambiguous, but based on the problem's context, it's more likely asking for when cumulative profit turns positive, which would be after 12 years of operation (Year 13). Therefore, the answer is 12 or 13?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem didn't consider the initial cost as part of the \"earning money\", but in reality, the initial cost is a sunk cost, and once he starts generating positive annual profit, he is earning money. However, that interpretation is unlikely, because the problem mentions the tree costs $90 to plant, so the $90 is part of the investment.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 12 years if we consider that after 12 years, he has broken even, and thus can start earning money from there on. But in reality, to have a positive net worth, it's 13 years. Therefore, the correct answer depends on the interpretation.\n\nLet's check similar problems. For example, if you have an initial cost and yearly profit, break-even is when total profits equal total costs. So, if someone asks \"how long until he starts making money\", the answer is the break-even point, which is 12 years. After that, each additional year is profit. So in the 12th year, he breaks even, so starting from the 13th year, he makes money. But the time taken before he starts is 12 years.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer 12, as 90 divided by 7.5 is 12, which gives the exact number of years needed to recoup the initial cost. So maybe the answer is 12.\n\nHowever, in reality, you need to have the total profits exceed the initial cost. Since after 12 years, total profit equals initial cost, so the net is zero. So in that case, he hasn't earned money yet. So the first year he actually earns money is the 13th year.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 13.\n\nBut let's verify with exact cash flows:\n\nYear 0: -90\n\nYear 1: +7.50, total -82.50\n\nYear 2: +7.50, total -75.00\n\n...\n\nYear 12</think>",
  "answer": "After carefully analyzing Carlos's lemon tree investment:\n\n- **Initial Cost**: $90\n- **Annual Revenue**: 7 lemons sold at $1.50 each = $10.50\n- **Annual Expense**: $3 (water and feed)\n- **Net Annual Profit**: $10.50 - $3 = $7.50\n\nTo determine when Carlos starts earning money (i.e., cumulative profit becomes positive), we solve for \\( n \\) in:\n\\[\n-90 + 7.50n > 0\n\\]\n\\[\n7.50n > 90\n\\]\n\\[\nn > \\frac{90}{7.50} = 12\n\\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) must be an integer, the smallest value is \\( n = 13 \\).
