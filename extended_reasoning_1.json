  "question": "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
  "reasoning": "\nOkay, so Janet has ducks that lay 16 eggs each day. Hmm, first, I need to figure out how many eggs she has left after she uses some for breakfast and baking muffins. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nShe eats three eggs every morning for breakfast. That's straightforward. Then she uses four eggs each day to bake muffins for her friends. So in total, she uses 3 + 4 eggs every day. Let me add those together: 3 plus 4 is 7. So she uses 7 eggs each day for her own consumption and baking.\n\nNow, the ducks lay 16 eggs daily. If she uses 7 eggs, the remaining eggs would be 16 minus 7. Let me do the subtraction: 16 minus 7 is 9. So, she has 9 eggs left each day to sell at the farmers' market.\n\nEach egg she sells for $2. So, to find out how much money she makes daily, I need to multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg. That would be 9 eggs multiplied by $2 per egg. Let me calculate that: 9 times 2 is 18. So, she makes $18 each day at the farmers' market.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Ducks lay 16 eggs. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins. 3+4=7. 16-7=9. 9 eggs sold at $2 each is 9*2=18. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nI guess another way to think about it is total eggs used daily versus sold. Yep, 16 total eggs, subtract 3 for breakfast, get 13, then subtract 4 for muffins, get 9. Then 9*$2 is $18. Same result. So, I think that's correct.\nWait, is there a possibility that the eggs used for baking are in addition to the ones she eats? Or is there any other way she might be using the eggs? The problem states she eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins every day with four. So that's two separate uses: consumption and baking. So 3 and 4. So total 7. Then leftovers sold. So yeah, 16-7=9. Then 9*2=18. That seems straightforward. \n\nIs the price per egg in dollars? The problem says she sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. So yes, each egg is $2. So 9 eggs would be 9*$2=$18. \n\nOkay, I think that's all. I don't see any hidden steps or misinterpretations here. So Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n\n\n**Final Answer**\nJanet makes \\boxed{18} dollars every day at the farmers' market.\nFor example, does she use the eggs on the same day they are laid? The problem says the ducks lay 16 eggs per day, and she uses three for breakfast every morning. So presumably, the eggs are used the same day they are laid. So she can't be using yesterday's eggs. So the total eggs available each day is 16. So that's correct.\n\nAlso, if she bakes muffins every day with four eggs, that's per day. So again, same day usage. So total eggs used per day: 3 + 4 =7. Therefore eggs remaining: 16 -7=9. Sold at $2 each: 9*2=18. That's right.\n\nYeah, I think that's solid. The answer should be $18.\nTotal eggs per day: 16\nBreakfast: 3 eggs\nMuffins: 4 eggs\nTotal used: 3 + 4 =7\nEggs left: 16 -7 =9\nMoney made: 9*$2= $18.\nSame result. Yep, definitely $18.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{18}\nFirst, the total eggs laid: 16.\nEggs eaten: 3.\nEggs baked: 4.\nTotal used: 3 + 4 = 7.\nEggs left: 16 -7=9.\nEach sold at $2: 9*2=18. Correct. So the answer is $18, which is boxed as \\boxed{18}.\nAlternatively, is there a possibility that the number of eggs used for muffins is per muffin? No, the problem says \"bakes muffins for her friends every day with four\". So four eggs each day, not per muffin. So that's four eggs total.\n\nYes, the answer is consistent. Therefore, I can confidently put the answer as \\boxed{18}.\nAnother way to approach: How much does she consume and how much does she sell?\n\nDaily egg production: 16\n\nDaily consumption:\n- Breakfast: 3\n- Muffins:4\n\nTotal daily consumption: 3 + 4 =7\n\nEggs remaining:16 -7=9\n\nPrice per egg: $2\n\nRevenue:9 *2=18.\n\nYes, correct. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{18}.\nLet me represent the problem in equations:\n\nLet E be the number of eggs laid per day: E =16\n\nLet B be the eggs eaten for breakfast: B=3\n\nLet M be the eggs used in muffins: M=4\n\nEggs sold S = E - (B + M) =16 - (3+4)=9\n\nRevenue R = S * price per egg =9 *2=18\n\nSame result. So the answer is 18. So \\boxed{18}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{18}\nWait, no, the original problem says she eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins with four. Each activity is separate. So total eggs used: 3 (breakfast) +4 (muffins)=7. Eggs left:16-7=9. Sold at $2 each: 9*2=18. Correct. There's no trick here.\n\nAlternatively, is there a possibility that the problem is per week? The problem says \"every day\" so it's per day.\n\nHence, the answer is $18 per day. Correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{18}\nThe problem states Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning. She bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. Then she sells the remainder. So each day, the total eggs laid are 16. Each day, she uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for muffins. Therefore, each day, 16-3-4=9 eggs are left, which she sells at $2 each. So 9*2=18. So yes, $18 per day.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is \\boxed{18}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{18}\nTotal eggs per day:16.\nTotal eggs consumed per day:3 +4=7.\nTherefore, eggs sold per day:16-7=9.\nMoney earned per day:9*2=18.\nSo, the answer is 18.\n\nAlternatively, using algebraic expressions:\nLet eggs sold = 16 -3 -4 =9.\nRevenue =9*2=18.\n\nSame answer. So in any case, 18 is the answer.\n\nTherefore, \\boxed{18} is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{18}\n",
