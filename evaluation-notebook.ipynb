I need to figure out how much money she makes daily from selling the eggs. Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the problem says her ducks lay 16 eggs per day. Wait, but wait, the instruction says to replace every number with 15. So instead of 16 eggs, it\\'s 15. Got it. So Janet\\'s ducks lay 15 eggs each day. Then she eats three for breakfast every morning. But wait, the original number was three, but the instruction says replace every number with 15. Wait, hold on. Wait, the original problem had numbers 16, three, four, and two. The instruction says to replace every number with 15. So all numbers in the problem become 15. Let me check that again.\\n\\nOriginal problem: \"Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers\\' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers\\' market?\"\\n\\nSo replacing each number with 15. So:\\n\\nJanet’s ducks lay 15 eggs per day. She eats 15 for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 15. She sells the remainder at the farmers\\' market daily for $15 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers\\' market?\\n\\nWait, but the original numbers were 16, 3, 4, 2. So each of those numbers is replaced by 15. So the number of eggs laid is 15, eaten for breakfast is 15, used for muffins is 15, and the price per egg is $15. Hmm. That seems like a lot of eggs being used and a high price per egg, but okay, following the instruction.\\n\\nSo let\\'s compute the remainder eggs she sells. First, total eggs laid: 15. Then subtract the eggs she eats: 15. Then subtract the eggs she uses for muffins: 15. So total used: 15 + 15 = 30. Wait, but she only has 15 eggs per day. So 15 - 15 -15 = -15. That can\\'t be right. Wait, that would mean she\\'s using more eggs than she has. So the remainder would be negative, which doesn\\'t make sense. But maybe I made a mistake here.\\n\\nWait, the original problem had 16 eggs, eats 3, uses 4. So 16 -3 -4 =9, sold at $2 each, so $18. But with all numbers replaced by 15, it\\'s 15 eggs, eats 15, uses 15. So 15 -15 -15 = -15. That\\'s negative. But you can\\'t have negative eggs to sell. So maybe in this case, the remainder is zero? But that would mean she can\\'t use more eggs than she has. So perhaps the problem as modified is impossible? But the question still expects an answer. Maybe the answer is zero? Because she uses all the eggs and has none left to sell.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the numbers replaced only where they are in the original problem. Let me check the instruction again: \"replace every number with 15\". So every number in the problem becomes 15. So the original numbers were 16, 3, 4, 2. So all of them become 15. So the problem becomes:\\n\\nJanet’s ducks lay 15 eggs per day. She eats 15 for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 15. She sells the remainder at the farmers\\' market daily for $15 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers\\' market?\\n\\nSo total eggs: 15. Eggs used for breakfast: 15. Eggs used for muffins: 15. Total used: 15 +15 =30. But she only has 15 eggs. So 15 -30 = -15. Since she can\\'t have negative eggs, the remainder is zero. Therefore, she can\\'t sell any eggs, so she makes $0. But let me check if that\\'s the case.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to proceed with the calculation even if it\\'s negative, but that doesn\\'t make sense in real life. So the answer would be zero. But let\\'s verify.\\n\\nTotal eggs: 15.\\n\\nUsed for breakfast: 15.\\n\\nUsed for muffins: 15.\\n\\nTotal used: 15 +15 =30.\\n\\nRemaining eggs: 15 -30 = -15. Since you can\\'t have negative eggs, the actual remaining is 0.\\n\\nTherefore, she sells 0 eggs. Each sold for $15, so 0 *15 = $0.\\n\\nSo she makes $0 every day at the farmers\\' market.\\n\\nBut wait, maybe the problem expects us to just do the arithmetic regardless of practicality. Let\\'s see. If we ignore the negative, then remainder is -15, but selling negative eggs isn\\'t possible. So the answer must be $0.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake because replacing all numbers with 15 leads to an impossible scenario, but the answer is zero. So the answer is $0.\\n\\nBut let me make sure I followed the instruction correctly. The original problem had numbers 16, 3, 4, 2. Replace each with 15. So yes, all numbers become 15. So the calculation is 15 -15 -15 = -15, but since you can\\'t have negative eggs, the remainder is 0. Therefore, she makes 0 *15 = $0.\\n\\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer is $0. But let me check again.\\n\\nOriginal problem after replacement:\\n\\nJanet’s ducks lay 15 eggs per day. She eats 15 for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 15. She sells the remainder at the farmers\\' market daily for $15 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers\\' market?\\n\\nTotal eggs:15.\\n\\nSubtract breakfast:15 → 15-15=0.\\n\\nSubtract muffins:15 → 0-15= -15. But since she can\\'t use more eggs than she has, she can only use 0 for muffins. Wait, but the problem states she bakes muffins every day with 15. So if she only has 0 eggs left after breakfast, she can\\'t use 15 for muffins. So perhaps the problem is impossible, but the answer is zero.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that even if the numbers result in a negative, we proceed with the calculation. But that would be selling -15 eggs, which isn\\'t possible. So the answer must be zero.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is $0.\\n\\n**Final Answer**\\nAnswer: $0\\n</think>\\n\\nJanet’s ducks lay 15 eggs per day. She eats 15 for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with 15. She sells the remainder at the farmers\\' market daily for $15 per fresh duck egg. \\n\\nTo determine how much she makes at the market:\\n1. **Total eggs laid**: 15  \\n2. **Eggs used for breakfast**: 15  \\n3. **Eggs used for muffins**: 15  \\n\\nSubtracting the eggs used from the total:  \\n\\\\[ 15 - 15 - 15 = -15 \\\\]  \\n\\nSince the remainder cannot be negative, the actual number of eggs left to sell is 0.  \\n\\n**Revenue from selling eggs**:  \\n\\\\[ 0 \\\\times 15 = 0 \\\\]  \\n\\nAnswer: $0',\n",
