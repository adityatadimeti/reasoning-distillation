          "reasoning": "Okay, so I have this AIME problem about a block of wood shaped like a right circular cylinder. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 8. The entire surface is painted blue. Points A and B are on the edge of one of the circular faces, and the arc AB on that face measures 120 degrees. Then, the block is sliced in half along a plane that passes through points A, B, and the center of the cylinder. This slicing reveals a flat, unpainted face on each half. The problem asks for the area of one of these unpainted faces, which is given in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, where a, b, and c are integers, and c is not divisible by the square of any prime. Then, I need to find a + b + c.\n\nAlright, so first, let me visualize this. There's a cylinder with radius 6 and height 8. The entire surface is painted, so the lateral surface and the two circular faces are all blue. Points A and B are on the edge of one circular face, with an arc AB of 120 degrees. So, the angle between them is 120 degrees. Then, the cylinder is sliced through A, B, and the center, resulting in two halves, each with an unpainted face.\n\nI need to find the area of one of these unpainted faces.\n\nHmm. So, the plane that slices the cylinder passes through A, B, and the center. Since A and B are on the edge of the circular face, and the center is the center of the cylinder, this plane is cutting through the cylinder.\n\nI should probably figure out the shape of this unpainted face. Since it's a slice through the cylinder, it's going to be a flat surface. The shape of this surface is likely a portion of an ellipse or perhaps a triangle or something else.\n\nWait, when you slice a cylinder with a plane, the cross-section is an ellipse unless the plane is parallel to the side, in which case it's a rectangle, or perpendicular, which would be a circle. But in this case, the plane is passing through two points on the circumference of a circular face and the center, so the cross-section is probably an ellipse.\n\nWait, but actually, let me think again. The plane passes through points A, B, and the center of the cylinder. Since A and B are on the circumference of the circular face, and the center is the center of the cylinder, this plane is going to pass through the axis of the cylinder, right? Because the center is on the axis.\n\nWait, but if the plane passes through the axis, then the cross-section might actually be a rectangle or a parallelogram? No, because it's passing through the axis, which is a straight line, so the intersection of the plane with the cylinder should be an ellipse. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, if the plane contains the axis of the cylinder, then the cross-section is a rectangle, isn't it? Because the intersection of a plane containing the axis of a cylinder is a rectangle. Hmm, but in this case, the plane is passing through points A, B, and the center. Points A and B are on the circular face, but the plane also passes through the center.\n\nWait, so if the plane contains the axis (since it passes through the center and through points on the circumference), then the cross-section is a rectangle. But the problem says the area is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that it's a combination of a circular segment and something else. Hmm, maybe not a rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again. The cylinder is a right circular cylinder, so its cross-section when sliced by a plane that contains its axis is indeed a rectangle. The height of the rectangle would be the height of the cylinder, 8, and the width would be the diameter of the base, which is 12. So, the area would be 12 * 8 = 96. But in the problem, the unpainted face is a flat, unpainted face, and the area is given as a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which doesn't look like 96. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the plane doesn't contain the axis? Let me check. Points A and B are on the edge of one circular face, and the plane passes through A, B, and the center. The center is the center of the cylinder, which is on the axis. So, the plane does contain the axis because it contains the center and passes through A and B, which are on the circumference. So, the cross-section should be a rectangle.\n\nBut that contradicts the problem's statement about the area being in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, perhaps I'm wrong about the shape of the cross-section.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is not a rectangle but a different shape. Let me try to model this.\n\nImagine the cylinder with radius 6, height 8. Let's place it in a coordinate system where the axis of the cylinder is along the z-axis, from (0,0,0) to (0,0,8). The circular face on the bottom is at z=0, and the top face is at z=8.\n\nPoints A and B are on the edge of the bottom circular face, which is the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 in the plane z=0. The arc AB measures 120 degrees, so the angle between points A and B as viewed from the center is 120 degrees. So, if I parameterize points A and B on the circle, let's say point A is at (6, 0, 0). Then, since the arc AB is 120 degrees, point B would be 120 degrees around the circle from A.\n\nIn coordinates, point B can be represented as (6 cos 120\u00b0, 6 sin 120\u00b0, 0). Calculating that, cos 120\u00b0 is -1/2, and sin 120\u00b0 is \u221a3/2. So, point B is at (6*(-1/2), 6*(\u221a3/2), 0) = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nWait, but hold on. If point A is at (6,0,0), moving 120 degrees counterclockwise would bring us to (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). But in the Asymptote code, it shows points A and B on the same face, but the code might have a different coordinate system.\n\nBut regardless, points A and B are on the circumference, 120 degrees apart, and the plane passes through A, B, and the center (0,0,0). So, the plane is defined by three points: A, B, and the origin.\n\nGiven that, the cross-section is the intersection of this plane with the cylinder. Let's figure out the shape of this cross-section.\n\nWait, since the plane passes through the axis (the origin), the cross-section should be a rectangle, as I thought earlier. But the problem says the area is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests a different shape.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The plane passes through points A, B, and the center, but the cross-section is not just the flat face but perhaps includes some curved parts?\n\nWait, no. When you slice a cylinder with a plane, the intersection is a conic section. If the plane is not parallel to the side, it's an ellipse. But if the plane contains the axis, it's a rectangle.\n\nWait, but in this case, the plane contains the axis, so the cross-section is a rectangle, right? So, maybe the area is 12*8=96, but the problem says it's a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac. Hmm, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the slicing is not through the entire cylinder, but only through half of it? But no, the block is sliced in half, so each half would have a flat face.\n\nWait, maybe the unpainted face is not the cross-section but the union of the cross-section and some other part?\n\nWait, no. When you slice the cylinder, the newly exposed face is just the cross-section of the plane with the cylinder. So, if the cross-section is a rectangle, the area should be 12*8=96. But the problem says it's a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is not a rectangle but a different shape because the plane is not passing through the entire cylinder? Wait, no, the plane passes through the entire cylinder, slicing it into two halves.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is actually a parallelogram instead of a rectangle? But if the plane is passing through the axis, which is straight, then the cross-section should be a rectangle.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parametrize the plane equation and find the intersection with the cylinder.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, let's place the cylinder in a coordinate system with its axis along the z-axis, from (0,0,0) to (0,0,8). The circular face at z=0 has equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nPoints A and B are on this circle, separated by a 120-degree arc. Let me take point A as (6,0,0) as before, so point B is at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nThe plane passes through A (6,0,0), B (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and the origin (0,0,0). So, the plane is defined by these three points.\n\nTo find the equation of the plane, let's find two vectors in the plane:\n\nVector OA = A - origin = (6,0,0)\nVector OB = B - origin = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nThe normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of OA and OB.\n\nCalculating the cross product:\n\nOA \u00d7 OB = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a00\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-3 3\u221a3 \u00a00\n\n= i*(0*0 - 0*3\u221a3) - j*(6*0 - 0*(-3)) + k*(6*3\u221a3 - 0*(-3))\n\n= i*(0 - 0) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(18\u221a3 - 0)\n\n= (0, 0, 18\u221a3)\n\nSo, the normal vector is (0, 0, 18\u221a3), which simplifies to (0, 0, 1) when normalized.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the cross product is (0,0,18\u221a3), then the normal vector is in the positive z-direction. But the plane containing points A, B, and the origin is not horizontal; it's slanting.\n\nWait, but according to the cross product, the normal vector is along the z-axis, which would mean the plane is horizontal, but that's not the case because points A and B are on the z=0 plane, and the origin is also on z=0. So, the plane is the z=0 plane itself? But that can't be, because point A is (6,0,0), B is (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and origin is (0,0,0), so yes, all three points lie on the z=0 plane.\n\nWait, that's not correct because the problem says the block is sliced in half along the plane that passes through A, B, and the center, revealing an unpainted face on each half. But if the plane is z=0, then it's the base of the cylinder, which was already painted. So, that can't be the case.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the coordinate system. Maybe the center is at (0,0,4) instead of (0,0,0). Wait, the height is 8, so the center would be at (0,0,4). So, perhaps I need to adjust the coordinate system.\n\nLet me reorient the cylinder so that the center is at (0,0,4), with the bottom face at z=0 and the top face at z=8. Then, point A is on the bottom face at (6,0,0), point B is at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and the center is at (0,0,4).\n\nSo, now, the plane passes through A (6,0,0), B (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and the center (0,0,4). So, three points not all on the same z-plane, so the plane is tilted.\n\nAlright, so let's find the equation of the plane passing through these three points.\n\nPoints:\nA: (6,0,0)\nB: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\nC: (0,0,4)\n\nWe can find two vectors in the plane:\nVector AC = C - A = (-6, 0, 4)\nVector BC = C - B = (3, -3\u221a3, 4)\n\nNow, the normal vector to the plane is the cross product of AC and BC.\n\nCalculating the cross product:\n\nAC \u00d7 BC = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-6 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a04\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03 -3\u221a3 \u00a04\n\n= i*(0*4 - 4*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-6*4 - 4*3) + k*(-6*(-3\u221a3) - 0*3)\n\n= i*(0 + 12\u221a3) - j*(-24 - 12) + k*(18\u221a3 - 0)\n\n= (12\u221a3)i - (-36)j + 18\u221a3 k\n\n= (12\u221a3, 36, 18\u221a3)\n\nWe can simplify this normal vector by dividing by 6:\n\n(2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3)\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is:\n\n2\u221a3(x - 6) + 6(y - 0) + 3\u221a3(z - 0) = 0\n\nWait, using point A (6,0,0) to plug into the plane equation.\n\nSo,\n\n2\u221a3(x - 6) + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n2\u221a3 x - 12\u221a3 + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 0\n\nBring constants to the other side:\n\n2\u221a3 x + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 12\u221a3\n\nWe can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n(2\u221a3/3)x + 2y + \u221a3 z = 4\u221a3\n\nAlternatively, write it as:\n\n2\u221a3 x + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 12\u221a3\n\nEither way, that's the plane equation.\n\nNow, to find the intersection of this plane with the cylinder.\n\nThe cylinder has equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36, and z goes from 0 to 8.\n\nWe can parametrize the intersection curve by expressing z in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom the plane equation:\n\n2\u221a3 x + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 12\u221a3\n\nLet me solve for z:\n\n3\u221a3 z = 12\u221a3 - 2\u221a3 x - 6y\n\nDivide both sides by 3\u221a3:\n\nz = (12\u221a3 - 2\u221a3 x - 6y)/(3\u221a3)\n\nSimplify:\n\nz = (12\u221a3)/(3\u221a3) - (2\u221a3 x)/(3\u221a3) - (6y)/(3\u221a3)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n12\u221a3 / (3\u221a3) = 4\n- (2\u221a3 x)/(3\u221a3) = - (2x)/3\n- (6y)/(3\u221a3) = - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nSo, z = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nTherefore, the intersection curve is given by:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36\nz = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nSo, to find the shape of the intersection, we can substitute z into the cylinder equation, but it's already given.\n\nWait, but to find the area of the unpainted face, which is the cross-section, I need to compute the area of this intersection.\n\nBut the cross-section is an ellipse because the intersection of a plane and a cylinder is an ellipse unless the plane is parallel to the side, which would give a rectangle, or perpendicular, which would give a circle.\n\nBut in this case, the plane is tilted, so the intersection is an ellipse.\n\nSo, the area of the unpainted face is the area of this ellipse.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the area of this ellipse?\n\nI know that when a plane intersects a cylinder, the area of the ellipse can be found using the formula:\n\nArea = (circumference of the base circle) * (length along the axis) / (something?)\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Alternatively, the area can be found by considering the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nAlternatively, the area can be found by parametrizing the ellipse and computing the area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the area using the parametrization.\n\nWait, let's recall that the area of an ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the area of the cross-section can be found by taking the area of the base circle and scaling it by the factor related to the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, actually, in general, when a plane intersects a cylinder at an angle \u03b8 with respect to the axis, the area of the cross-section is (circumference) * (height) / sin \u03b8 or something like that. Wait, no, that's for the lateral surface area.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the area of the ellipse.\n\nThe area of the ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis.\n\nBut how to find a and b?\n\nAlternatively, since the cross-section is an ellipse, we can find its major and minor axes by finding the points where the plane intersects the cylinder.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to compute the area using a parameterization.\n\nLet me try to parametrize the ellipse.\n\nWe can parametrize the cylinder as:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = z\n\nBut we also have the plane equation:\n\nz = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nSo, substituting x and y:\n\nz = 4 - (2*(6 cos \u03b8))/3 - (2*(6 sin \u03b8))/\u221a3\n= 4 - (12 cos \u03b8)/3 - (12 sin \u03b8)/\u221a3\n= 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - (12 sin \u03b8)/\u221a3\n\nSimplify:\n\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nSo, the parametrization of the intersection curve is:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nThis is a parametrization of the ellipse.\n\nNow, to find the area of the ellipse, I can use the formula for the area of a parametric surface.\n\nWait, but this is a curve, not a surface. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the area by integrating over the parameter \u03b8.\n\nBut the area of the ellipse is a fixed number, so maybe I can find it using the parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute the angle between the plane and the axis of the cylinder and then use that to find the scaling factor for the area.\n\nWait, the area of the cross-section (the ellipse) is equal to the area of the base circle divided by cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, actually, when you have a slant cut, the area of the cross-section is equal to the area of the base circle divided by cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the cutting plane and the axis.\n\nWait, but in this case, the cross-section is an ellipse, and the area is \u03c0ab.\n\nBut the base circle has radius 6, so its area is 36\u03c0.\n\nIf the plane is inclined at an angle \u03b8 to the axis, then the area of the ellipse is (36\u03c0)/cos \u03b8.\n\nWait, is that the case?\n\nWait, actually, when you have a cylinder and you slice it at an angle \u03b8, the area of the cross-section is equal to the area of the base circle divided by cos \u03b8. So, yes, Area = 36\u03c0 / cos \u03b8.\n\nTherefore, if I can find \u03b8, the angle between the plane and the axis, then I can compute the area as 36\u03c0 / cos \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find cos \u03b8, then I can compute the area.\n\nSo, how to find \u03b8?\n\n\u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis of the cylinder.\n\nWait, the angle between the plane and the axis can be found by taking the angle between the normal vector of the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, the angle between the plane and the axis is equal to 90 degrees minus the angle between the normal vector and the axis.\n\nWait, let me recall that the angle between a plane and a line is equal to the complement of the angle between the normal vector and the line.\n\nSo, if \u03c6 is the angle between the normal vector and the axis, then \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - \u03c6.\n\nSo, to find \u03b8, I can compute \u03c6 first.\n\nGiven that, let's compute \u03c6, the angle between the normal vector of the plane and the axis.\n\nThe normal vector of the plane is (2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3). The axis of the cylinder is along the vector (0,0,8), which can be represented as (0,0,1) for direction.\n\nThe angle \u03c6 between the normal vector and the axis can be found using the dot product:\n\ncos \u03c6 = (normal vector \u00b7 axis) / (|normal vector| |axis|)\n\nCompute the dot product:\n\n(2\u221a3)(0) + (6)(0) + (3\u221a3)(1) = 3\u221a3\n\nCompute |normal vector|:\n\n|normal vector| = sqrt( (2\u221a3)^2 + 6^2 + (3\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt( 12 + 36 + 27 ) = sqrt(75) = 5\u221a3\n\nCompute |axis| = 1 (since we're using the unit vector (0,0,1))\n\nSo, cos \u03c6 = (3\u221a3) / (5\u221a3) = 3/5\n\nTherefore, \u03c6 = arccos(3/5)\n\nTherefore, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - \u03c6\n\nSo, cos \u03b8 = sin \u03c6\n\nSince sin \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6) = sqrt(1 - 9/25) = sqrt(16/25) = 4/5\n\nTherefore, cos \u03b8 = 4/5\n\nSo, the area of the cross-section is 36\u03c0 / cos \u03b8 = 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 36\u03c0 * (5/4) = 45\u03c0\n\nWait, that's a nice number, but the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, 45\u03c0 would mean b=0, but in the problem, it's specified that the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is not 45\u03c0. Let me verify.\n\nWait, another way to compute the area of the ellipse is to use the parametrization and compute the area using the formula for the area of a parametric curve.\n\nWait, no, the area of the cross-section is the area of the ellipse, which can be found by scaling the area of the base circle by 1/cos \u03b8, as I did before. But according to that, it's 45\u03c0, which is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with b=0. But the problem says both a and b are integers, and c is square-free. So, perhaps 45\u03c0 is the area, and then a=45, b=0, c=0, but c=0 is not square-free. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is incorrect because the cross-section is not an ellipse? Wait, no, slicing a cylinder with a plane at an angle should give an ellipse.\n\nWait, but in this case, the plane passes through the center, so maybe it's a different kind of cross-section.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the cross-section is a triangle or a quadrilateral?\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a continuous curve, so it's either a circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, etc. Since the plane is not parallel to the side, nor cutting through the apex, it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, so why does the problem say the area is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac? Maybe my calculation is wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again about the area formula. Maybe instead of dividing by cos \u03b8, it's not that straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is not just the ellipse but also includes some part of the original painted surface?\n\nWait, no, the unpainted face is just the cross-section. So, it should be the area of the ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area of the ellipse differently.\n\nWait, the area of an ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find the lengths of the major and minor axes, I can compute the area.\n\nAlternatively, since the cylinder is being cut by a plane, the intersection is an ellipse whose major axis is the diameter of the cylinder divided by cos \u03b8, and the minor axis remains the same as the diameter.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of the cross-section can be found by computing the area of the parallelogram formed by the intersection.\n\nWait, but it's an ellipse, not a parallelogram.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area by using the parametrization and integrating over \u03b8.\n\nGiven the parametrization:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nBut how does that help me find the area?\n\nWait, actually, the cross-section is a closed curve, so the area can be found by using the formula for the area of a parametric curve in 3D.\n\nWait, but I think the formula for the area of a parametric surface is different. Wait, no, for a parametric curve, it's just the length, not the area.\n\nWait, perhaps I can project the ellipse onto a plane where it's easier to compute the area.\n\nWait, if I can find a coordinate system where the ellipse becomes a circle, then the area would be \u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since the ellipse is the intersection of the plane and the cylinder, and the cylinder has radius 6, the semi-minor axis of the ellipse is 6, and the semi-major axis can be found based on the angle.\n\nWait, the semi-minor axis is the same as the radius of the cylinder, which is 6, and the semi-major axis is 6 / cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, but earlier, I found cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so the semi-major axis would be 6 / (4/5) = 6 * (5/4) = 30/4 = 15/2 = 7.5.\n\nTherefore, the area would be \u03c0 * (15/2) * 6 = \u03c0 * (90/2) = 45\u03c0. So, same result as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the area is 45\u03c0, which would be a=45, b=0, c=0, but c is supposed to be square-free and non-zero. So, maybe I'm still missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section isn't the entire ellipse, but only a part of it?\n\nWait, no, when you slice the cylinder through A, B, and the center, you're cutting through the entire cylinder, so the cross-section is a full ellipse.\n\nWait, but the problem says the block is sliced in half, so the unpainted face is half of the ellipse? Wait, no, slicing along a plane divides the cylinder into two halves, each with an unpainted face, which is the cross-section. So, each half has an entire ellipse as its unpainted face.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac\". So, 45\u03c0 would be the area, which is of the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with b=0, but c must be square-free. So, 0 is not allowed for c? Wait, c is in the term b\u221ac, so if b=0, then the term is 0, and c can be anything, but the problem says c is not divisible by the square of any prime, which is vacuous if b=0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written as \"a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac\", so it's possible that b could be zero, but c is still square-free. However, in the problem, they might have meant that c is non-zero and square-free, but the problem statement doesn't specify that. So, perhaps 45\u03c0 is acceptable, with a=45, b=0, c=0, but c=0 is not square-free.\n\nWait, 0 is divisible by every prime squared, so it's not square-free. Therefore, c must be non-zero and square-free. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you slice a cylinder with a plane that passes through two points on the base and the center, the cross-section is actually a rectangle, but in this case, since the plane is not vertical, it's a parallelogram.\n\nWait, no, because the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, so it's a rectangle if the plane is vertical.\n\nWait, but in this case, the plane is not vertical because it's tilted. Wait, in the coordinate system, the plane passes through (6,0,0), (-3,3\u221a3,0), and (0,0,4). So, it's a slant plane.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle, but the sides are not straight up and down.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is a rectangle with one side being the chord AB on the base and the other side being the line from the center to the top.\n\nWait, but no, the plane slices through the entire cylinder, so the cross-section is actually a rectangle, but the sides are slanting.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with sides of length equal to the chord AB and the height of the cylinder.\n\nWait, chord AB on the base has length 2*6*sin(60\u00b0) = 12*(\u221a3/2) = 6\u221a3.\n\nSo, chord AB is 6\u221a3, and the height is 8. So, the cross-section would be a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 8, so the area would be 48\u221a3.\n\nBut in the problem, the area is given as a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, 48\u221a3 would be a=0, b=48, c=3, which are integers, and c=3 is square-free. Then, a + b + c = 0 + 48 + 3 = 51.\n\nBut wait, if the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 8, then the area is 48\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=48, c=3.\n\nBut in that case, the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so 0 is allowed for a? The problem doesn't specify that a, b, c are non-zero, just that c is square-free.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the cross-section was an ellipse, but if the cross-section is a rectangle, then the area is 48\u221a3.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When you slice a cylinder with a plane that contains the axis, the cross-section is a rectangle. But in this case, the plane does not contain the axis, because the center is at (0,0,4), not on the z=0 plane.\n\nWait, no, the plane passes through the center (0,0,4), point A (6,0,0), and point B (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). So, the plane is not horizontal, and it doesn't contain the axis because the axis is the line from (0,0,0) to (0,0,8). The plane passes through (0,0,4), which is the midpoint, but not the entire axis.\n\nWait, but the plane passes through the center (0,0,4), which is on the axis, and through points A and B on the base. So, the plane contains the center and points A and B, which are on the circumference of the base.\n\nWait, but the axis is from (0,0,0) to (0,0,8). So, the plane passes through (0,0,4), which is on the axis, but not through the entire axis.\n\nSo, in that case, the cross-section is an ellipse.\n\nWait, so earlier, I thought it was a rectangle, but actually, it's an ellipse because the plane doesn't contain the entire axis.\n\nWait, but the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, but only one point on the axis.\n\nWait, so the cross-section is an ellipse.\n\nTherefore, going back, the area is 45\u03c0, but the problem says a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, perhaps my previous approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area differently.\n\nWait, another approach: The cross-section is an ellipse, and its area can be computed using the formula involving the determinant of a matrix formed by vectors in the plane.\n\nWait, the area of the ellipse can be found by computing the area scaling factor when projecting from the cylinder to the plane.\n\nAlternatively, since the cross-section is an ellipse, the area can be found by calculating the area of the parallelogram formed by two vectors on the plane and then dividing by the sine of the angle between them or something.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the area of a parametric surface.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a curve, not a surface.\n\nWait, perhaps the area can be found by computing the magnitude of the cross product of the tangent vectors.\n\nWait, but that's for surfaces. For a curve, the area isn't directly defined.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the formula for the area of an ellipse given by a parametrization.\n\nWait, if I have the parametrization of the ellipse, I can compute the area using a line integral.\n\nWait, yes, the area can be computed using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) \u222b(x dy - y dx)\n\nBut since this is a closed curve, I can use Green's theorem.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nGiven the parametrization:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nBut for the area, since it's an ellipse in 3D, I need to project it onto a 2D plane.\n\nWait, perhaps I can parameterize the ellipse in 2D.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find the major and minor axes.\n\nWait, since the cross-section is an ellipse, and we have the parametrization, maybe we can find the maximum and minimum distances from the center.\n\nWait, the ellipse is centered at some point?\n\nWait, no, the plane cuts through the cylinder, so the ellipse is centered at the center of the cylinder?\n\nWait, not necessarily. Wait, the plane passes through the center of the cylinder, which is at (0,0,4). So, the ellipse is centered at (0,0,4).\n\nWait, so the ellipse is in the plane z = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3, centered at (0,0,4).\n\nWait, to find the major and minor axes, perhaps I can find the points on the ellipse farthest from the center.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps it's better to perform a coordinate transformation to align the plane with a coordinate plane.\n\nWait, let's try to find a coordinate system where the plane becomes the xy-plane, then the ellipse would be easier to analyze.\n\nBut that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the area by using the parametrization.\n\nWait, since the parametrization is:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nI can think of this as a parametric curve in 3D, and the area of the ellipse can be found by computing the integral over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nWait, but I need a way to compute the area of the ellipse from this parametrization.\n\nWait, I found a formula online that says the area of a parametric ellipse can be found by integrating over the parameter, but I can't remember exactly.\n\nWait, another idea: The ellipse is the image of the unit circle under a linear transformation.\n\nWait, if I can express the parametrization as a linear transformation of the unit circle, then the area would be the determinant of the transformation matrix.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nLet me define a parameter t such that:\n\nx = 6 cos t\n\ny = 6 sin t\n\nThen, z = 4 - 4 cos t - 4\u221a3 sin t\n\nBut z is dependent on t, so this is a curve in 3D.\n\nWait, but to find the area of the ellipse, I need to consider the mapping from the parameter t to the ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the ellipse as a parameterized surface in 3D, but it's actually a curve.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The cross-section is an ellipse, and the area can be found by computing the length of the major and minor axes.\n\nWait, to find the major and minor axes, I can find the points on the ellipse that are farthest from the center.\n\nWait, the ellipse is in the plane z = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3.\n\nWait, the center of the ellipse is at the point where the plane intersects the axis of the cylinder, which is at (0,0,4).\n\nWait, so the center is (0,0,4). Then, the ellipse is centered at (0,0,4).\n\nSo, to find the major and minor axes, I can find the points on the ellipse that are farthest along the direction of the plane's normal vector and the direction perpendicular to it.\n\nWait, perhaps the major axis is in the direction of the projection of the cylinder's axis onto the plane.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the area by using the fact that the area of the ellipse is equal to the area of the base circle times the ratio of the height in the direction perpendicular to the plane.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nThe area of the ellipse can be found by considering the scaling factor due to the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, the area of the ellipse is equal to the area of the base circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nEarlier, I found that the angle \u03b8 between the plane and the axis satisfies cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so the area would be 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that there is a radical term, so perhaps 45\u03c0 is not the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that the cross-section is an ellipse is wrong, and instead, the cross-section is a different shape.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the area by another method.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a triangle.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a continuous curve, so it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is not just 45\u03c0, but includes some other term.\n\nWait, another idea: The unpainted face is not just the cross-section but also includes some part of the lateral surface.\n\nWait, but the problem says the block is sliced in half, revealing a flat, unpainted face on each half. So, it's just the cross-section.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area of the ellipse correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of the ellipse can be computed as the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors in the plane.\n\nWait, since the cross-section is an ellipse, which is a stretched circle, the area is the area of the circle times the scaling factor.\n\nWait, in this case, the circle has radius 6, so area 36\u03c0. The scaling factor is the factor by which the plane is inclined relative to the axis.\n\nWait, so the scaling factor is 1 / cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nEarlier, I found that cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so the scaling factor is 5/4.\n\nTherefore, the area is 36\u03c0 * (5/4) = 45\u03c0.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous result.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that it's a combination of a \u03c0 term and a radical term.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is not just an ellipse but also includes some other geometric shape.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is a combination of a sector of the circle and a triangle or something else.\n\nWait, no, when you slice the cylinder, the cross-section is just the intersection curve, which is an ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is computed differently.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area using the plane's equation and the cylinder's equation.\n\nSo, the intersection curve is given by:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36\n\nz = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nSo, we can express y in terms of x and z, or x in terms of y and z.\n\nWait, but how does that help in computing the area?\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area by integrating over x and y.\n\nWait, the area can be found by computing the double integral over the region in the plane.\n\nWait, but that might be complicated.\n\nWait, another idea: The area of the ellipse can be found by computing the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors defining the ellipse.\n\nWait, if I can find two orthonormal vectors in the plane, I can compute the area.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nWe have the plane with normal vector n = (2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3). Let's find two orthonormal vectors in the plane.\n\nFirst, let's find two vectors in the plane:\n\nVector v1 = A - C = (6,0,0) - (0,0,4) = (6,0,-4)\n\nVector v2 = B - C = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) - (0,0,4) = (-3, 3\u221a3, -4)\n\nNow, we can use these vectors to form a basis for the plane.\n\nFirst, normalize v1:\n\n|v1| = sqrt(6\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + (-4)\u00b2) = sqrt(36 + 16) = sqrt(52) = 2\u221a13\n\nSo, unit vector u1 = (6/(2\u221a13), 0, -4/(2\u221a13)) = (3/\u221a13, 0, -2/\u221a13)\n\nNext, find a vector orthogonal to u1 in the plane.\n\nTake v2 and subtract its projection onto u1.\n\nCompute projection of v2 onto u1:\n\nproj_u1(v2) = (v2 \u00b7 u1) u1\n\nv2 \u00b7 u1 = (-3)(3/\u221a13) + (3\u221a3)(0) + (-4)(-2/\u221a13) = (-9/\u221a13) + 0 + (8/\u221a13) = (-1)/\u221a13\n\nSo, proj_u1(v2) = (-1/\u221a13) * (3/\u221a13, 0, -2/\u221a13) = (-3/13, 0, 2/13)\n\nThen, the orthogonal component is v2 - proj_u1(v2):\n\nv2_orth = (-3, 3\u221a3, -4) - (-3/13, 0, 2/13) = (-3 + 3/13, 3\u221a3 - 0, -4 - 2/13) = (-36/13, 3\u221a3, -54/13)\n\nNow, normalize v2_orth:\n\n|v2_orth| = sqrt( (-36/13)^2 + (3\u221a3)^2 + (-54/13)^2 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-36/13)^2 = (1296)/(169)\n(3\u221a3)^2 = 27\n(-54/13)^2 = (2916)/(169)\n\nSo, |v2_orth| = sqrt(1296/169 + 27 + 2916/169)\n\nConvert 27 to 27*169/169 = 4563/169\n\nSo,\n\n|v2_orth| = sqrt( (1296 + 4563 + 2916)/169 ) = sqrt( (1296 + 2916 = 4212; 4212 + 4563 = 8775 ) / 169 )\n\n= sqrt(8775 / 169) = sqrt(8775)/13\n\nFactor 8775: 8775 \u00f7 25 = 351; 351 \u00f7 9 = 39; 39 \u00f7 13 = 3. So, 8775 = 25 * 9 * 13 * 3 = 25 * 9 * 39\n\nSo, sqrt(8775) = sqrt(25 * 9 * 39) = 5 * 3 * sqrt(39) = 15\u221a39\n\nTherefore, |v2_orth| = 15\u221a39 / 13\n\nSo, unit vector u2 = ( (-36/13) / (15\u221a39 /13 ), (3\u221a3) / (15\u221a39 /13 ), (-54/13) / (15\u221a39 /13 ) )\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nFirst component: (-36/13) / (15\u221a39 /13 ) = (-36)/(15\u221a39) = (-12)/(5\u221a39) = (-12\u221a39)/(5*39) = (-12\u221a39)/195 = (-4\u221a39)/65\n\nSecond component: (3\u221a3) / (15\u221a39 /13 ) = (3\u221a3 * 13) / (15\u221a39 ) = (39\u221a3) / (15\u221a39 ) = (13\u221a3)/(5\u221a39 ) = (13\u221a3)/(5\u221a39 ) = (13\u221a(3/39))/5 = (13\u221a(1/13))/5 = (13/(\u221a13))/5 = (\u221a13)/5\n\nThird component: (-54/13) / (15\u221a39 /13 ) = (-54)/(15\u221a39 ) = (-18)/(5\u221a39 ) = (-18\u221a39)/(5*39) = (-18\u221a39)/195 = (-6\u221a39)/65\n\nTherefore, unit vector u2 = ( (-4\u221a39)/65, \u221a13/5, (-6\u221a39)/65 )\n\nNow, with u1 and u2 as orthonormal vectors in the plane, the area of the ellipse can be found by the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors when transformed from the cylinder's base.\n\nWait, actually, the area of the ellipse is equal to the area of the base circle times the scaling factor due to the angle.\n\nBut since we have the orthonormal basis, the area scaling factor is the determinant of the transformation matrix.\n\nWait, the area of the ellipse is equal to the area of the unit circle times the determinant of the matrix formed by the transformation vectors.\n\nBut in this case, the transformation is from the base circle to the ellipse in the plane.\n\nWait, the area is equal to the area of the base circle times the square root of the determinant of the matrix product of the transformation.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the area can be found by the product of the lengths of u1 and u2, but since they are orthonormal, that product is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The area of the ellipse can be found by the formula:\n\nArea = (1 / |n \u00b7 k| ) * (Area of base circle)\n\nWhere k is the unit vector in the z-direction.\n\nWait, let's compute n \u00b7 k, where n is the normal vector.\n\nn = (2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3)\n\nk = (0,0,1)\n\nn \u00b7 k = 3\u221a3\n\n|n \u00b7 k| = 3\u221a3\n\nTherefore, Area = (1 / 3\u221a3 ) * 36\u03c0 = 12\u03c0 / \u221a3 = 4\u03c0\u221a3\n\nWait, that's different. 4\u03c0\u221a3.\n\nWait, but let's verify this.\n\nWait, the formula for the area of the cross-section when slicing a cylinder with a plane is Area = (Area of base) / |cos \u03b8|, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nBut earlier, I found cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so Area = 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nBut now, using the formula involving the normal vector, I get 4\u03c0\u221a3.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. So, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the formula.\n\nI think the formula is:\n\nWhen slicing a cylinder with radius r along a plane, the area of the cross-section is (2\u03c0r\u00b2) / |n \u00b7 k|, where n is the unit normal vector of the plane.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area is equal to the area of the base circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nBut in that case, 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, using the normal vector, the area is equal to (Area of base circle) / |n \u00b7 k|, where n is the unit normal vector.\n\nWait, n is (2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3). Its magnitude is sqrt( (2\u221a3)^2 + 6^2 + (3\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt(12 + 36 + 27) = sqrt(75) = 5\u221a3.\n\nSo, the unit normal vector is (2\u221a3 / (5\u221a3), 6 / (5\u221a3), 3\u221a3 / (5\u221a3)) = (2/5, 6/(5\u221a3), 3/5).\n\nThen, n \u00b7 k = 3/5.\n\nSo, the area would be (Area of base circle) / |n \u00b7 k| = 36\u03c0 / (3/5) = 36\u03c0 * (5/3) = 60\u03c0.\n\nWait, now it's 60\u03c0.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier result.\n\nI think I need to find a reliable formula.\n\nWait, according to some references, the area of the cross-section of a cylinder by a plane is equal to the area of the base circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nSo, if \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis, then Area = (\u03c0r\u00b2) / cos \u03b8.\n\nEarlier, I found cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so Area = 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, another formula says that the area is equal to (2\u03c0r\u00b2) / |n \u00b7 k|, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because different sources define the angle differently.\n\nWait, let me instead compute the area using the parametrization.\n\nGiven the parametrization:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nWe can compute the area using the formula for the area of a parametric surface.\n\nWait, but this is a curve, not a surface.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use the formula for the area of a surface of revolution, but that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area by integrating the magnitude of the cross product of the tangent vectors.\n\nWait, yes, for a parametric curve, the area enclosed can be found by integrating (1/2)(x dy - y dx) over the parameter.\n\nWait, yes, Green's theorem can be applied here.\n\nSo, let's use Green's theorem to compute the area.\n\nGreen's theorem states that the area enclosed by a curve is (1/2) \u222b(x dy - y dx) over the curve.\n\nSo, let's compute \u222b(x dy - y dx) over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nGiven:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\ndx = -6 sin \u03b8 d\u03b8\ndy = 6 cos \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\nx dy - y dx = (6 cos \u03b8)(6 cos \u03b8 d\u03b8) - (6 sin \u03b8)(-6 sin \u03b8 d\u03b8)\n= 36 cos\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8 + 36 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8\n= 36 (cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8) d\u03b8\n= 36 d\u03b8\n\nTherefore, the integral \u222b(x dy - y dx) from \u03b8=0 to \u03b8=2\u03c0 is \u222b36 d\u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 = 36*(2\u03c0) = 72\u03c0\n\nTherefore, the area is (1/2)*72\u03c0 = 36\u03c0.\n\nWait, that's just the area of the base circle. That can't be right because the cross-section is an ellipse, which should have a different area.\n\nWait, but according to Green's theorem, if I parameterize the curve in the plane, I should get the area of the ellipse.\n\nBut in this case, I parameterized the curve in 3D, but when projected onto the plane, it's still a closed curve.\n\nWait, but in reality, the cross-section is an ellipse, so the area should be larger than the base circle.\n\nBut according to this calculation, it's 36\u03c0, which is the same as the base circle. That can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying Green's theorem because the curve is in 3D, not in 2D.\n\nWait, Green's theorem applies to planar curves. So, since the cross-section is in a tilted plane, I need to project it onto a 2D coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the area by scaling the result.\n\nWait, the area computed using Green's theorem is 36\u03c0, but that's in the 3D space. However, the ellipse is a 2D figure, so perhaps the area is scaled by the factor related to the angle.\n\nWait, earlier, I found that the cross-section area is 45\u03c0, which is 36\u03c0 / cos \u03b8, with cos \u03b8 = 4/5.\n\nSo, 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the area is 45\u03c0.\n\nBut again, the problem says it's a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that the area is a combination of a \u03c0 term and a radical term.\n\nSo, perhaps my entire approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is not an ellipse but a triangle or a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, no, slicing a cylinder with a plane that isn't parallel to the side or the base will result in an elliptical cross-section.\n\nWait, unless the plane is tangent, but in this case, it's passing through two points and the center, so it's a secant plane.\n\nSo, it's definitely an ellipse.\n\nWait, so why is the problem saying the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the cross-section is not a full ellipse but a portion of it.\n\nWait, but the plane slices through the entire cylinder, so the cross-section is a full ellipse.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering only half of the ellipse, but the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces\".\n\nEach half of the cylinder has an entire ellipse as its unpainted face.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the angle \u03b8.\n\nEarlier, I found cos \u03b8 = 4/5, but perhaps it's actually sin \u03b8 = 4/5.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nThe angle between the plane and the axis is \u03b8.\n\nThe angle between the normal vector and the axis is \u03c6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - \u03c6.\n\nWe found cos \u03c6 = 3/5, so \u03c6 = arccos(3/5).\n\nTherefore, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - arccos(3/5) = arcsin(3/5).\n\nWait, no, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle between the normal and the axis.\n\nSo, cos \u03c6 = 3/5, so \u03c6 = arccos(3/5). Therefore, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - arccos(3/5).\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = sin(90\u00b0 - \u03c6) = cos \u03c6 = 3/5.\n\nWait, no, sin(90\u00b0 - \u03c6) = cos \u03c6, so sin \u03b8 = 3/5.\n\nWait, but \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis, so sin \u03b8 = 3/5.\n\nTherefore, cos \u03b8 = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2 \u03b8) = sqrt(1 - 9/25) = sqrt(16/25) = 4/5.\n\nTherefore, cos \u03b8 = 4/5, which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the area is 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nSo, why does the problem say it's a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac?\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is not the entire ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says the block is sliced in half along the plane that passes through A, B, and the center, revealing a flat, unpainted face on each half.\n\nSo, each half has a flat, unpainted face, which is the cross-section.\n\nBut if the cross-section is an ellipse with area 45\u03c0, then why does the problem specify the area as a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac?\n\nWait, unless the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape whose area includes both \u03c0 and a radical term.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a combination of a sector and a triangle.\n\nWait, let me think again about the cross-section.\n\nWait, the plane passes through A, B, and the center.\n\nSo, in the base circle, the chord AB is 120 degrees, so the length is 6\u221a3, as I found before.\n\nIn the cylinder, the plane slices through the cylinder from A to B, passing through the center.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle with one side being the chord AB and the other side being the line from the center to the top of the cylinder.\n\nWait, but the center is at (0,0,4), so the line from the center to the top is 4 units.\n\nWait, so the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the area is 6\u221a3 * 4 = 24\u221a3.\n\nWait, but that's inconsistent with the previous results.\n\nWait, but if the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 4, then the area is 24\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=24, c=3. Then, a + b + c = 0 + 24 + 3 = 27.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the cross-section is an ellipse with area 45\u03c0, but this approach suggests it's a rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle because the plane passes through the center and two points on the base, so it slices the cylinder vertically.\n\nWait, but in that case, the cross-section should be a rectangle.\n\nWait, let me consider the cylinder as a stack of circles. If I slice it with a plane that goes through the center and two points on the base, the cross-section would be a rectangle.\n\nWait, but in reality, the cross-section of a cylinder with a plane that is not perpendicular to the axis and not parallel to the side is an ellipse, unless it's parallel or perpendicular.\n\nWait, but in this case, the plane is passing through the center, which is on the axis, and through two points on the base.\n\nWait, so the plane is not perpendicular to the axis, nor is it parallel to the side.\n\nWait, so the cross-section should be an ellipse.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought of it as a rectangle, but that's when the plane contains the axis, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, but also through two points on the base. So, the plane is not containing the entire axis, just passing through one point on it.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is an ellipse.\n\nBut then, why does the area come out to 45\u03c0, which is purely a \u03c0 term?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a triangle.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a continuous curve, so it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area using another method.\n\nWait, let me compute the area using the parametrization.\n\nWe have the parametrization:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nTo compute the area of the ellipse, I can use the formula for the area of a parametric surface, but it's a curve, so that's not applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area by finding the lengths of the major and minor axes.\n\nWait, the major axis is the diameter divided by cos \u03b8, which is 6 / (4/5) = 7.5, as before.\n\nThen, the minor axis remains 6.\n\nSo, the area is \u03c0 * 7.5 * 6 = 45\u03c0.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which is confusing.\n\nWait, unless the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, let me think about the nature of the cross-section.\n\nThe plane passes through A, B, and the center.\n\nSo, in the base circle, points A and B are separated by 120 degrees.\n\nSo, the chord AB is 6\u221a3.\n\nThe plane also passes through the center, so it's like slicing the cylinder with a knife that goes through A, B, and the center.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle with length AB = 6\u221a3 and height equal to the distance from the center to the top, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle with area 6\u221a3 * 4 = 24\u221a3.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was an ellipse, but this makes sense.\n\nWait, but if the cross-section is a rectangle, then the area is 24\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=24, c=3.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so a=0 is allowed.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the Asymptote code shows a more complex shape.\n\nWait, looking back at the Asymptote code, it's drawing surfaces, but I can't visualize it perfectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle, but the problem is referring to the area of the face, which is a rectangle.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's a right circular cylinder, so slicing through A, B, and the center would create a flat face that's a rectangle.\n\nWait, so if the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 4, then the area is 24\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, a=0, b=24, c=3, so a + b + c = 0 + 24 + 3 = 27.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which would be 0\u00b7\u03c0 + 24\u221a3.\n\nBut is 24\u221a3 the correct area?\n\nWait, let me think again. If the cross-section is a rectangle, then yes.\n\nBut why did I initially think it was an ellipse?\n\nBecause when a plane slices a cylinder at an angle, it's usually an ellipse, but in this case, the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, so maybe it's a rectangle.\n\nWait, actually, when the plane passes through the axis, the cross-section is a rectangle.\n\nWait, in this case, the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, but not through the entire axis.\n\nWait, but the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, and through two points on the base.\n\nSo, the plane is not containing the entire axis, just passing through one point on it.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is not a rectangle but an ellipse.\n\nWait, so I'm confused again.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the cross-section as a parallelogram.\n\nThe plane slices the cylinder, creating a parallelogram.\n\nThe base of the parallelogram is the chord AB, which is 6\u221a3, and the height is the distance from the center to the top, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the area is 6\u221a3 * 4 = 24\u221a3.\n\nBut in that case, the cross-section is a parallelogram, not an ellipse.\n\nWait, but a parallelogram is a type of ellipse? No, a parallelogram is a flat shape with four sides, while an ellipse is a smooth curve.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle if the plane is perpendicular to the axis, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, I think I need to resolve this confusion.\n\nWait, in the case where the plane contains the axis, the cross-section is a rectangle. In this problem, the plane does not contain the entire axis, just the center, which is a single point on the axis.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is an ellipse.\n\nTherefore, the area is 45\u03c0, which is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=45, b=0, c=0, but c=0 is not square-free.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a triangle.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a closed curve, so it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the lateral surface area, but the problem says the area of the unpainted face, which is flat.\n\nTherefore, it's the area of the ellipse, which is 45\u03c0.\n\nBut then, why does the problem have the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac?\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 45\u03c0, so a=45, b=0, c=0, but c=0 is not allowed. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the area using another method.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with sides AB and the height.\n\nAB is 6\u221a3, and the height is 8, so the area is 6\u221a3 * 8 = 48\u221a3.\n\nBut then, the area is 48\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=48, c=3, so a + b + c = 0 + 48 + 3 = 51.\n\nBut this contradicts the previous results.\n\nWait, but in reality, the height of the cylinder is 8, but the distance from the center to the top is 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the height along the plane is different.\n\nWait, the plane is tilted, so the height of the cross-section is not 8, but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with sides AB = 6\u221a3 and the height along the plane.\n\nWait, but the height along the plane would be the distance from A to the top along the plane.\n\nWait, point A is at (6,0,0), and the top of the cylinder is at z=8.\n\nBut the plane passes through A, B, and the center.\n\nSo, the line from A to the top along the plane would be a line from (6,0,0) to (6,0,8), but that's not on the plane.\n\nWait, no, the plane equation is z = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3.\n\nSo, to find the point on the plane at z=8, we can set z=8 and solve for x and y.\n\n8 = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nSo,\n\n(2x)/3 + (2y)/\u221a3 = 4 - 8 = -4\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n2x + (6y)/\u221a3 = -12\n\nSimplify:\n\n2x + 2\u221a3 y = -12\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx + \u221a3 y = -6\n\nSo, the line of intersection at z=8 is x + \u221a3 y = -6.\n\nBut this line is outside the cylinder, since the cylinder at z=8 is the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nSo, the plane intersects the top face of the cylinder at points where x + \u221a3 y = -6 and x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nSolving these equations:\n\nFrom x + \u221a3 y = -6, we have x = -6 - \u221a3 y.\n\nSubstitute into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36:\n\n(-6 - \u221a3 y)^2 + y\u00b2 = 36\n\nExpand:\n\n(36 + 12\u221a3 y + 3 y\u00b2) + y\u00b2 = 36\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n36 + 12\u221a3 y + 4 y\u00b2 = 36\n\nSubtract 36:\n\n12\u221a3 y + 4 y\u00b2 = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n4 y (3\u221a3 + y) = 0\n\nSo, y = 0 or y = -3\u221a3\n\nIf y = 0, then x = -6 - \u221a3*0 = -6\n\nIf y = -3\u221a3, then x = -6 - \u221a3*(-3\u221a3) = -6 + 9 = 3\n\nTherefore, the plane intersects the top face at (-6, 0, 8) and (3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nSo, the cross-section is a quadrilateral with vertices at A (6,0,0), B (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), (-6, 0, 8), and (3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nWait, so the cross-section is actually a quadrilateral, not an ellipse.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a four-sided figure, a trapezoid or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, let's check the coordinates.\n\nPoint A: (6,0,0)\n\nPoint B: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nPoint C: (-6, 0, 8)\n\nPoint D: (3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nSo, connecting A to B to C to D to A.\n\nWait, is this a planar figure? Yes, because all points lie on the slicing plane.\n\nSo, the cross-section is a quadrilateral.\n\nNow, to compute its area, perhaps we can divide it into two triangles or use the shoelace formula.\n\nBut since it's in 3D, we need to project it onto a 2D plane.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the area using vectors.\n\nCompute vectors AB, AC, AD, etc., but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a planar quadrilateral, we can compute its area by finding the magnitude of the cross product of its diagonals or something else.\n\nWait, another idea: The area of a planar polygon in 3D can be computed by projecting it onto a coordinate plane.\n\nFirst, find a coordinate system on the plane.\n\nAlternatively, compute the area using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) | (AB \u00d7 AD) + (BC \u00d7 BD) | or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area by using the coordinates.\n\nLet me list the coordinates of the quadrilateral:\n\nA: (6,0,0)\n\nB: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nC: (-6, 0, 8)\n\nD: (3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nWait, connecting A to B to C to D to A.\n\nThis is a non-planar quadrilateral? Wait, no, all points lie on the slicing plane, so it's planar.\n\nTo compute the area, perhaps I can use the shoelace formula in 3D.\n\nBut the shoelace formula works in 2D. So, I need to project the quadrilateral onto a 2D plane.\n\nFirst, find a coordinate transformation that maps the 3D points to 2D.\n\nGiven the plane equation, we can define a local coordinate system on the plane.\n\nLet me define two orthonormal vectors on the plane.\n\nEarlier, we found:\n\nu1 = (3/\u221a13, 0, -2/\u221a13)\n\nu2 = (-4\u221a39/65, \u221a13/5, -6\u221a39/65 )\n\nThese are orthonormal vectors in the plane.\n\nNow, we can express each point in terms of these vectors.\n\nBut this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the area using the following formula for a planar polygon in 3D:\n\nArea = (1/2) |sum_{i=1 to n} (Pi \u00d7 Pi+1)|, where Pi are the position vectors relative to a point on the plane.\n\nBut this requires knowing the normal vector.\n\nWait, another formula: The area can be computed as (1/2) times the magnitude of the sum over edges of the cross products.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the following approach:\n\nGiven four points A, B, C, D in order, the area can be computed as the sum of the areas of triangles ABC and ACD.\n\nBut since the quadrilateral is planar, this should work.\n\nCompute the area of triangle ABC and the area of triangle ACD, then add them.\n\nCompute area of triangle ABC:\n\nPoints A (6,0,0), B (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), C (-6, 0, 8)\n\nVectors AB = B - A = (-9, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nVectors AC = C - A = (-12, 0, 8)\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-9 3\u221a3 \u00a00|\n|-12 \u00a00 \u00a0\u00a08|\n\n= i*(3\u221a3*8 - 0*0) - j*(-9*8 - 0*(-12)) + k*(-9*0 - 3\u221a3*(-12))\n\n= i*(24\u221a3) - j*(-72) + k*(36\u221a3)\n\n= (24\u221a3, 72, 36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (24\u221a3)^2 + 72^2 + (36\u221a3)^2 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(24\u221a3)^2 = 576 * 3 = 1728\n\n72^2 = 5184\n\n(36\u221a3)^2 = 1296 * 3 = 3888\n\nTotal: 1728 + 5184 + 3888 = 10800\n\nsqrt(10800) = sqrt(100 * 108) = 10 * sqrt(108) = 10 * 6 * sqrt(3) = 60\u221a3\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*60\u221a3 = 30\u221a3\n\nSimilarly, compute the area of triangle ACD:\n\nPoints A (6,0,0), C (-6, 0, 8), D (3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nVectors AC = C - A = (-12, 0, 8)\n\nVectors AD = D - A = (-3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nCompute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-12 \u00a00 \u00a0\u00a08|\n|-3 -3\u221a3 \u00a08|\n\n= i*(0*8 - 8*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-12*8 - 8*(-3)) + k*(-12*(-3\u221a3) - 0*(-3))\n\n= i*(24\u221a3) - j*(-96 + 24) + k*(36\u221a3 - 0)\n\n= (24\u221a3, 72, 36\u221a3)\n\nSame as before, magnitude is 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ACD is (1/2)*60\u221a3 = 30\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the total area of the quadrilateral ABCD is 30\u221a3 + 30\u221a3 = 60\u221a3.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the area of the quadrilateral should be less than the lateral surface area.\n\nWait, but according to this calculation, the area is 60\u221a3, which is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3, so a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier results.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the cross product for triangle ABC, I got 60\u221a3, which seems too large.\n\nWait, let me verify the cross product calculation.\n\nFor triangle ABC:\n\nVectors AB = (-9, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nVectors AC = (-12, 0, 8)\n\nCross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\ni: (3\u221a3 * 8 - 0 * 0) = 24\u221a3\n\nj: - ( (-9 * 8 - 0 * (-12)) ) = - ( -72 ) = 72\n\nk: ( (-9 * 0 - 3\u221a3 * (-12)) ) = 0 + 36\u221a3 = 36\u221a3\n\nSo, cross product is (24\u221a3, 72, 36\u221a3)\n\nMagnitude squared: (24\u221a3)^2 + 72^2 + (36\u221a3)^2 = 1728 + 5184 + 3888 = 10800\n\nsqrt(10800) = 60\u221a3\n\nSo, magnitude is 60\u221a3, so area is 30\u221a3.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle ACD, cross product is same, so area is 30\u221a3.\n\nTotal area: 60\u221a3.\n\nBut this seems large. Let me check the coordinates again.\n\nPoint A: (6,0,0)\n\nPoint B: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nPoint C: (-6, 0, 8)\n\nPoint D: (3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nPlotting these points, they form a symmetric quadrilateral.\n\nBut 60\u221a3 seems too large for the area.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product.\n\nWait, the cross product for triangle ABC is AB \u00d7 AC, but actually, for the area, it should be AB \u00d7 AC divided by 2.\n\nWait, no, the area is half the magnitude of the cross product.\n\nWait, yes, I did that: 60\u221a3 / 2 = 30\u221a3.\n\nSimilarly for the other triangle.\n\nTherefore, the total area is 60\u221a3.\n\nBut according to the problem, the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac.\n\nSo, 60\u221a3 is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\nSo, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct because I thought the cross-section was an ellipse with area 45\u03c0.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, the cross-section is a quadrilateral with area 60\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac\".\n\nIf the cross-section is a quadrilateral, then the area is 60\u221a3, which is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a triangle, but according to the coordinates, it's a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering only half of the cross-section.\n\nBut the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces\", and each half has an entire face.\n\nSo, if the cross-section is a quadrilateral with area 60\u221a3, then that's the area.\n\nBut according to the Asymptote code, the figure is more complex, but I can't visualize it perfectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is actually a triangle, but I have four points.\n\nWait, no, the plane slices through four points: A, B, C, D, forming a quadrilateral.\n\nTherefore, the area is 60\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which is possible with a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\nTherefore, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nBut in the problem, the answer is supposed to be between 0 and 999, so 63 is acceptable.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the cross-section was an ellipse with area 45\u03c0, which would be 45\u03c0 + 0\u221ac, but c=0 is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, if the cross-section is a rectangle, area 24\u221a3, which would be 0\u03c0 +24\u221a3, but again, c=3 is square-free.\n\nBut according to the coordinates, the cross-section is a quadrilateral with area 60\u221a3.\n\nWait, but when I computed the cross-section as a quadrilateral, I considered two triangles each with area 30\u221a3, so total 60\u221a3.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate system.\n\nWait, another idea: Since the plane is cutting through the cylinder, the cross-section is actually a rectangle with sides equal to the chord AB and the height.\n\nWait, chord AB is 6\u221a3, and the height is 8, so area is 6\u221a3 * 8 = 48\u221a3.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but in reality, the height along the plane is not 8, because the plane is tilted.\n\nWait, so the height is not 8, but something else.\n\nWait, the height along the plane can be found by computing the distance between the two circular faces along the plane.\n\nBut that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 4, giving area 24\u221a3.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a parallelogram with base 6\u221a3 and height 4, giving area 24\u221a3.\n\nBut according to the coordinate calculation, the area is 60\u221a3.\n\nI think I need to resolve this.\n\nWait, let me consider the plane slicing the cylinder.\n\nThe cross-section is a rectangle if the plane is perpendicular to the axis, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, but the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, so perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle.\n\nWait, but the plane also passes through two points on the base, which are not on the axis.\n\nWait, so the cross-section is a rectangle with one side being the chord AB and the other side being the line from the center to the top.\n\nWait, but the line from the center to the top is perpendicular to the base, so in this case, it's vertical.\n\nBut the chord AB is horizontal.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle with sides AB = 6\u221a3 and height 4.\n\nTherefore, the area is 6\u221a3 * 4 = 24\u221a3.\n\nBut according to the coordinate calculation, it's 60\u221a3.\n\nSo, there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle, but the height is not 4.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, the center is at (0,0,4), so the distance from the center to the top is 4.\n\nTherefore, the height of the rectangle is 4, and the base is AB = 6\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area is 24\u221a3.\n\nBut according to the coordinate calculation, it's 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle, but in reality, the plane is cutting through the cylinder at an angle, so the cross-section is actually a parallelogram with sides AB and the height along the plane.\n\nBut in that case, the area is base times height, where base is AB = 6\u221a3, and height is the distance from the line AB to the opposite line on the top face.\n\nWait, the height would be the perpendicular distance between the lines AB and CD on the top face.\n\nBut AB is on the base, CD is on the top.\n\nWait, the distance between AB and CD is the height of the cylinder, which is 8, but projected along the plane.\n\nWait, but the plane is tilted, so the height along the plane is longer.\n\nWait, the height along the plane can be found by dividing the actual height by cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nEarlier, we found cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so the height along the plane is 8 / (4/5) = 10.\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is base times height along the plane: 6\u221a3 * 10 = 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area is 60\u221a3.\n\nBut that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, but if the cross-section is a parallelogram with base AB = 6\u221a3 and height along the plane = 10, then the area is 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area is 60\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\nTherefore, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the Asymptote code shows a more complex shape, but I can't be sure.\n\nWait, but according to the coordinate calculation, the area is 60\u221a3, which is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 63.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 45\u03c0, which is also a possible answer, but with a different form.\n\nBut according to the calculation of the quadrilateral, it's 60\u221a3.\n\nI think I need to decide which approach is correct.\n\nThe key is whether the cross-section is a quadrilateral or an ellipse.\n\nWait, in reality, slicing a cylinder with a plane results in an ellipse unless the plane is parallel to a side or passes through the axis.\n\nIn this case, the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, but not through the entire axis.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section should be an ellipse.\n\nBut according to the coordinate calculation, the cross-section is a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, that suggests that the cross-section is actually a rectangle, but the calculation shows a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle when the plane is perpendicular to the axis, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, but not through the entire axis.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle.\n\nWait, but according to the coordinate calculation, it's a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find another way.\n\nWait, the cross-section is a rectangle if the plane is perpendicular to the axis, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, but the plane passes through the center and two points on the base.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle.\n\nWait, but according to the coordinates, it's a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the points.\n\nWait, the plane intersects the top face at (-6,0,8) and (3, -3\u221a3,8).\n\nSo, the cross-section is a quadrilateral with vertices at (6,0,0), (-3, 3\u221a3,0), (-6,0,8), (3, -3\u221a3,8).\n\nThis is a trapezoid.\n\nWait, a trapezoid has two sides parallel.\n\nCheck if any sides are parallel.\n\nCompute vectors:\n\nAB: from A (6,0,0) to B (-3, 3\u221a3,0): (-9, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nCD: from C (-6,0,8) to D (3, -3\u221a3,8): (9, -3\u221a3, 0)\n\nSo, AB and CD are negatives of each other, meaning they are parallel and equal in magnitude.\n\nSimilarly, BC: from B (-3, 3\u221a3,0) to C (-6,0,8): (-3, -3\u221a3,8)\n\nAD: from A (6,0,0) to D (3, -3\u221a3,8): (-3, -3\u221a3,8)\n\nSo, BC and AD are equal vectors, meaning they are parallel and equal in magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a parallelogram.\n\nTherefore, the area can be computed as the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AD.\n\nVectors AB = (-9, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nVectors AD = (-3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nCompute cross product AB \u00d7 AD:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-9 3\u221a3 \u00a00|\n|-3 -3\u221a3 \u00a08|\n\n= i*(3\u221a3*8 - 0*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-9*8 - 0*(-3)) + k*(-9*(-3\u221a3) - 3\u221a3*(-3))\n\n= i*(24\u221a3) - j*(-72) + k*(27\u221a3 + 9\u221a3)\n\n= (24\u221a3, 72, 36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (24\u221a3)^2 + 72^2 + (36\u221a3)^2 )\n\n= sqrt( 1728 + 5184 + 3888 )\n\n= sqrt(10800) = 60\u221a3\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area of the unpainted face is 60\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\nThus, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 63.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{63}\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a right circular cylinder with radius 6 and height 8, where the entire surface is painted blue. Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are on the edge of one of the circular faces, and the arc \\(\\overarc{AB}\\) measures \\(120^\\circ\\). The block is sliced along the plane passing through \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and the center of the cylinder, revealing an unpainted face on each half.\n\nTo solve this, we need to determine the area of the unpainted face. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Understanding the Cross-Section**: The plane passes through points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and the center of the cylinder, resulting in a flat, unpainted face. This cross-section is a parallelogram because the plane intersects the cylinder at an angle.\n\n2. **Coordinates of Points**: Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are on the circular face with radius 6. The coordinates of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are \\((6, 0, 0)\\) and \\((-3, 3\\sqrt{3}, 0)\\) respectively. The center of the cylinder is at \\((0, 0, 4)\\).\n\n3. **Vectors and Cross Product**: We calculate the vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{AD} \\) to find the cross product, which helps determine the area of the parallelogram. The vectors are:\n   - \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} = (-9, 3\\sqrt{3}, 0) \\)\n   - \\( \\overrightarrow{AD} = (-3, -3\\sqrt{3}, 8) \\)\n\n4. **Cross Product Calculation**: The cross product of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{AD} \\) is computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{AB} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n   \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n   -9 & 3\\sqrt{3} & 0 \\\\\n   -3 & -3\\sqrt{3} & 8\n   \\end{vmatrix} = (24\\sqrt{3}, 72, 36\\sqrt{3})\n   \\]\n\n5. **Magnitude of Cross Product**: The magnitude of the cross product vector is:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(24\\sqrt{3})^2 + 72^2 + (36\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{10800} = 60\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Area of Parallelogram**: The area of the parallelogram is half the magnitude of the cross product:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60\\sqrt{3} = 30\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\nHowever, considering the entire cross-section, the area is actually the magnitude of the cross product, which is \\(60\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n7. **Form of the Area**: The area is given as \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\). Here, \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 60\\), and \\(c = 3\\). Thus, \\(a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{63}\n\\]",

          "reasoning": "Okay, so I have this AIME problem about a cylinder that's been painted and then sliced. Let me try to visualize it first. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 8. Points A and B are on the edge of one circular face, and the arc AB measures 120 degrees. The block is sliced in half along a plane that goes through A, B, and the center of the cylinder, revealing an unpainted face. I need to find the area of this face, which is given in the form \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\), and then compute \\(a + b + c\\).\n\nFirst, I remember that when you slice a cylinder with a plane, the resulting cross-section can be various shapes depending on the angle of the cut. Since the plane passes through points A and B on the circular face and the center, I think the cross-section might be an ellipse or some kind of quadrilateral.\n\nWait, in the initial attempt, the person thought it might be an ellipse but then reconsidered. Let me think about it more carefully. The cylinder is a right circular cylinder, so it's symmetric around its central axis. Points A and B are 120 degrees apart on the circumference, which is one-third of the full circle. The plane goes through these two points and the center, so it's like slicing the cylinder from one point, through the center, to another point on the opposite side.\n\nHmm, if I imagine looking at the cylinder from the side, the plane would pass through the center and the two points on the base. Since the cylinder is symmetrical, this plane would create a cross-section that is a rectangle or maybe a parallelogram. But since the points A and B are on the edge, the plane isn't just slicing straight through the height, but at an angle because the arc AB is 120 degrees.\n\nLet me try to model this. The cylinder can be represented parametrically. The circular base has a radius of 6, so the coordinates of points A and B can be determined. Let's set up a coordinate system where the center of the circular face is at the origin (0,0,0), and the height is along the z-axis. So, point A is at (6, 0, 0), and since the arc AB is 120 degrees, point B will be 120 degrees around the circle from A.\n\nThe angle in radians is \\(120^\\circ = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\). So, point B has coordinates (6 cos 120\u00b0, 6 sin 120\u00b0, 0). Calculating that, cos 120\u00b0 is -0.5 and sin 120\u00b0 is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), so point B is at (-3, \\(3\\sqrt{3}\\), 0). Wait, but hold on, if we have a 120-degree arc on the circular face, depending on the direction, point B could be either above or below. But in this case, since the cylinder is a right circular cylinder, the height is along the z-axis, so point A is at (6, 0, 0), and point B is at (-3, \\(3\\sqrt{3}\\), 0) if we go counterclockwise, or (-3, \\(-3\\sqrt{3}\\), 0) if we go clockwise.\n\nBut in the Asymptote code provided, it seems like the points A and B are on opposite sides. Wait, looking at the Asymptote code, it's a bit complicated, but in the asy code, point A is labeled at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and point B is at (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). So, actually, point A is at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) and point B is at (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). So, the arc AB is 120 degrees on the circular face.\n\nWait, that seems different from my initial thought. So, point A is at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), point B is at (-3, -3\u221a3, 0), and the center is at (0,0,0). So, the plane passes through these three points: A, B, and the center. So, the plane is defined by these three points.\n\nSo, to find the cross-sectional area, I need to find the shape of the intersection of the plane with the cylinder. Since the plane passes through the center, it should create a symmetrical cross-section.\n\nLet me try to parametrize the plane. The plane passes through points A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0), and the center O(0, 0, 0). So, these three points define the plane. Let's find the equation of the plane.\n\nFirst, vectors OA and OB can be found. Vector OA is from O to A: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). Vector OB is from O to B: (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). The normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of OA and OB.\n\nCalculating OA \u00d7 OB:\n\nOA = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\nOB = (-3, -3\u221a3, 0)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i \u00a0 \u00a0 j \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 k \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n|-3 \u00a03\u221a3 \u00a0 0|\n|-3 -3\u221a3 \u00a0 0|\n\n= i*(3\u221a3*0 - 0*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-3*0 - 0*(-3)) + k*(-3*(-3\u221a3) - (-3)*3\u221a3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= i*(0 - 0) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(9\u221a3 - (-9\u221a3))\n\n= 0i - 0j + (9\u221a3 + 9\u221a3)k\n\n= 18\u221a3 k\n\nSo, the normal vector is (0, 0, 18\u221a3). Therefore, the plane equation is of the form 0(x - 0) + 0(y - 0) + 18\u221a3(z - 0) = 0, which simplifies to z = 0. Wait, but that can't be right because points A and B are on the base z=0, but the plane also passes through the center, which is also on z=0. That would mean the plane is the base itself, which doesn't make sense because the cross-section would just be the circular face, but the problem says it's sliced in half along this plane, revealing an unpainted face. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the normal vector.\n\nWait, points A, B, and O are all on the base, which is the plane z=0. So, if I slice along the plane z=0, it's just the base, which is already painted. That can't be right because the problem says it's sliced in half along the plane passing through A, B, and the center, revealing an unpainted face. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the points A and B are not on the same circular face but on different faces? Or maybe the center is the center of the cylinder, but the plane passes through A, B, and the center, which is along the height.\n\nWait, the cylinder has two circular faces, top and bottom, each with radius 6 and height 8. Points A and B are on the edge of one of the circular faces. So, if I choose one face, say the bottom face, points A and B are on that face, 120 degrees apart. The plane passes through A, B, and the center of the cylinder, which is the point (0,0,4) if the height is 8? Wait, no, the center of the cylinder is the point (0,0,4) if the height is 8, but actually, in a cylinder, the center is often considered as the midpoint of the axis. So, if the height is 8, the axis goes from (0,0,0) to (0,0,8), so the center is at (0,0,4).\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says the plane passes through A, B, and the center of the cylinder. So, if A and B are on the bottom face, which is at z=0, then the center is at (0,0,4). So, the plane passes through A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0), and O(0,0,4).\n\nAh, that's different. So, the plane isn't the base, but it's a plane passing through three non-collinear points: A, B, and O. So, let's recast that.\n\nSo, points A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0), and O(0,0,4). Let's find the equation of the plane passing through these three points.\n\nTo find the equation of the plane, we can use the general plane equation: ax + by + cz = d.\n\nWe can plug in the three points to find a, b, c, d.\n\nFirst, plugging in A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0):\n\n-3a + 3\u221a3 b + 0*c = d --> -3a + 3\u221a3 b = d ... (1)\n\nPlugging in B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0):\n\n-3a - 3\u221a3 b + 0*c = d --> -3a - 3\u221a3 b = d ... (2)\n\nPlugging in O(0,0,4):\n\n0*a + 0*b + 4c = d --> 4c = d ... (3)\n\nSo, from equations (1) and (2):\n\nFrom (1): -3a + 3\u221a3 b = d\n\nFrom (2): -3a - 3\u221a3 b = d\n\nSubtracting (2) from (1):\n\n(-3a + 3\u221a3 b) - (-3a - 3\u221a3 b) = d - d\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n6\u221a3 b = 0 --> b = 0\n\nSo, b = 0. Then, from equation (1):\n\n-3a + 0 = d --> -3a = d\n\nFrom equation (3): 4c = d\n\nSo, we have:\n\n-3a = 4c --> c = (-3/4)a\n\nSo, let's choose a value for a. Let\u2019s set a = 4 for simplicity, then c = -3.\n\nSo, the plane equation is 4x + 0*y - 3z = d. From equation (3), 4c = d, but c = -3, so d = 4*(-3) = -12.\n\nWait, no. Wait, equation (3) is 4c = d. If c = -3, then d = 4*(-3) = -12.\n\nSo, the plane equation is 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nWe can write it as 4x - 3z + 12 = 0 or 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nLet me check if point A satisfies this: 4*(-3) - 3*0 = -12 --> -12 = -12, yes. Point B: 4*(-3) - 3*0 = -12, same. Point O: 4*0 - 3*4 = -12 --> -12 = -12, yes. So, that works.\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nNow, to find the cross-section of the cylinder with this plane. The cylinder is given by x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 = 36, since it's a right circular cylinder around the z-axis.\n\nThe intersection of the plane 4x - 3z = -12 with the cylinder x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36 will give us the cross-section. To find the area of this cross-section, we can parametrize the intersection curve.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to find the shape of the cross-section. Since the plane is not perpendicular to the cylinder's axis and doesn't pass through the axis (except at the center), the cross-section should be an ellipse.\n\nWait, in the initial attempt, the person thought it was an ellipse but got an area of 45\u03c0, which didn't fit the required form. But maybe I need to re-examine that.\n\nAlternatively, the cross-section could be a rectangle or a parallelogram. Wait, but in a cylinder, when you slice with a plane that isn't parallel to the sides, you usually get an ellipse or a hyperbola, but since the plane intersects the cylinder along a closed curve, it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, but in our case, the plane passes through the center of the cylinder, which might complicate things. Wait, actually, for a right circular cylinder, any plane that isn't parallel to the side will intersect in an ellipse, unless it's tangent, which would be a line.\n\nBut given that the plane passes through the center, the cross-section should be an ellipse.\n\nWait, but in the initial attempt, the person thought it was a parallelogram. Maybe that's incorrect. Let me think.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to parametrize the cylinder and find the intersection with the plane.\n\nParametrizing the cylinder: x = 6 cos \u03b8, y = 6 sin \u03b8, z = z, where \u03b8 is from 0 to 2\u03c0, and z is from 0 to 8.\n\nNow, plug this into the plane equation 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nSo, 4*(6 cos \u03b8) - 3z = -12 --> 24 cos \u03b8 - 3z = -12 --> 3z = 24 cos \u03b8 + 12 --> z = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4.\n\nSo, for each \u03b8, z is determined as 8 cos \u03b8 + 4. So, the intersection curve is given by:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4\n\nSo, we can write this as a parametric curve. To find the area of the cross-section, we can consider this curve lies on the plane and compute the area.\n\nBut wait, the cross-section is a curve, but the area is of the flat face. Wait, no, the cross-section is a curve, but since the cylinder is being sliced, the resulting face is a surface, but in 3D, the cross-section is a curve, but the area we need is the area of the flat, newly exposed face, which is a planar region.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the shape of the cross-section, which is an ellipse, and compute its area.\n\nBut how do I compute the area of the ellipse? The area of an ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nAlternatively, since the cross-section is an ellipse, we can find its major and minor axes.\n\nBut to find the major and minor axes, we can consider the angle between the cutting plane and the axis of the cylinder.\n\nWait, the cylinder's axis is along the z-axis. The cutting plane is 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nThe angle between the plane and the z-axis can be found by considering the normal vector of the plane. The normal vector is (4, 0, -3). The angle \u03c6 between the normal vector and the z-axis is given by the dot product:\n\ncos \u03c6 = (normal \u2022 z-axis) / (|normal| |z-axis|) = (-3)/sqrt(4\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + (-3)\u00b2) = (-3)/5.\n\nSo, cos \u03c6 = -3/5, so \u03c6 = arccos(-3/5).\n\nThe angle between the plane and the z-axis is 90\u00b0 - \u03c6.\n\nThe semi-minor axis of the ellipse is equal to the radius of the cylinder, which is 6, because the ellipse is formed by the intersection of the plane with the cylinder.\n\nThe semi-major axis can be found by a = r / sin \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for the major axis when slicing a cylinder. If the cylinder has radius r and the angle between the cutting plane and the axis is \u03b8, then the major axis is a = r / sin \u03b8.\n\nBut in our case, the angle between the plane and the axis is 90\u00b0 - \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle between the normal vector and the z-axis.\n\nSo, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - \u03c6.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = sin(90\u00b0 - \u03c6) = cos \u03c6 = | -3/5 | = 3/5.\n\nTherefore, a = 6 / (3/5) = 6 * (5/3) = 10.\n\nSo, the semi-major axis is 10, and the semi-minor axis is 6.\n\nTherefore, the area of the ellipse is \u03c0ab = \u03c0*10*6 = 60\u03c0.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the area is in the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac. But 60\u03c0 is just a multiple of \u03c0, so that would mean b = 0, which contradicts the problem statement because it implies both a and b are non-zero.\n\nWait, maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section isn't an ellipse. Maybe it's a different shape.\n\nWait, let me think again. The plane is slicing through the cylinder, but also through the center. So, maybe the cross-section is a rectangle or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, in the Asymptote code, it seems like the cross-section is a rectangle or something with flat sides. Let me check the Asymptote code again.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, it's a bit complex, but it seems like the cross-section is a flat face with some curves. Wait, perhaps it's a combination of a rectangle and a curved part? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the plane cuts through the cylinder, and the intersection is an ellipse, but the unpainted face is not just the ellipse; it's the face of the half-cylinder. So, the area we need is the area of the cross-section, but perhaps it's more complicated.\n\nWait, no. When you slice the cylinder, the newly exposed face is the cross-section, which is an ellipse. So, the area should be the area of the ellipse. But according to my previous calculation, it's 60\u03c0, which doesn't fit the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac with b non-zero.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my assumption that the cross-section is an ellipse is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the cross-section is a rectangle. If the plane is slicing through the cylinder at an angle, the cross-section could be a rectangle with length equal to the height of the cylinder and width equal to the chord length AB.\n\nWait, chord AB on the circular face. Since arc AB is 120 degrees, the chord length AB is 2*r*sin(\u03b8/2), where \u03b8 is 120 degrees. So, chord length AB is 2*6*sin(60\u00b0) = 12*(\u221a3/2) = 6\u221a3.\n\nSo, chord AB is 6\u221a3. If the cross-section is a rectangle, then the area would be chord length times height, which is 6\u221a3*8 = 48\u221a3. But that's only the area of the rectangle. However, in reality, the cross-section is not a rectangle but a parallelogram because the plane is slicing through the cylinder at an angle.\n\nWait, so the cross-section is a parallelogram with base equal to chord AB (6\u221a3) and height equal to the height of the cylinder projected onto the direction perpendicular to AB.\n\nWait, but the height of the cylinder is 8, but the angle of the plane affects the effective height.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross-section is a rhombus or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area of the cross-section by integrating or by using vectors.\n\nWait, another way: The area of the cross-section can be found using the formula for the area of a planar section of a cylinder. The area is equal to the product of the length of the chord and the height of the cylinder divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure about that.\n\nAlternatively, since the cross-section is an ellipse, and I found the major axis as 10 and minor axis as 6, giving an area of 60\u03c0, but that doesn't fit the required form. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section isn't an ellipse because the plane passes through the center, so the cross-section is actually a rectangle? Wait, no, because the plane isn't perpendicular to the cylinder's side.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with length equal to the height of the cylinder and width equal to the chord length AB, but that would be 6\u221a3 * 8 = 48\u221a3, which is a pure multiple of \u221a3, but the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac.\n\nHmm, conflicting results.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area by finding the shape of the cross-section.\n\nLet me try to find the parametric equations.\n\nWe have the cylinder x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nThe plane is 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nSo, we can express z from the plane equation: z = (4x + 12)/3.\n\nSubstitute this into the cylinder equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nSo, the cross-section is the set of points (x, y, (4x + 12)/3) where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nThis is a circle in the x-y plane, but when viewed in 3D, it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, but actually, the cross-section is a circle sheared along the z-axis, resulting in an ellipse.\n\nBut how do we compute the area of this ellipse?\n\nWait, in the plane 4x - 3z = -12, the cross-section is an ellipse. The area can be calculated by the area of the original circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, the area of the ellipse is equal to the area of the circle divided by cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, but I need to find \u03b8.\n\nWait, the angle \u03b8 is the angle between the cutting plane and the axis of the cylinder.\n\nThe normal vector of the plane is (4, 0, -3). The angle between the plane and the axis is the complement of the angle between the normal vector and the axis.\n\nSo, the angle \u03c6 between the normal vector and the z-axis is arccos(|-3| / |normal|) = arccos(3/5). So, \u03b8, the angle between the plane and the z-axis, is 90\u00b0 - \u03c6.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = 3/5.\n\nTherefore, the area of the ellipse is the area of the circle divided by sin \u03b8.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, when you have a circle viewed at an angle \u03b8, the area becomes Area_ellipse = Area_circle / cos \u03b8.\n\nBut in our case, the plane is cutting the cylinder, so the area is the area of the circle times the scaling factor due to the angle.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, the area can be found by calculating the determinant of the vectors defining the ellipse.\n\nWait, let's parametrize the cross-section.\n\nWe have x = 6 cos \u03b8, y = 6 sin \u03b8, z = (4x + 12)/3 = (24 cos \u03b8 + 12)/3 = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4.\n\nSo, the parametric equations are:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4\n\nNow, to find the area of the cross-section, which is an ellipse, we can use the formula for the area of a parametric surface.\n\nBut actually, since it's a planar ellipse, the area can be calculated by the magnitude of the cross product of the tangent vectors.\n\nWait, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since we know the semi-major and semi-minor axes, we can compute the area as \u03c0ab.\n\nEarlier, I thought a = 10 and b = 6, giving 60\u03c0, but that doesn't fit the required form.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the semi-major axis.\n\nWait, the formula for the semi-major axis when slicing a cylinder at an angle \u03b8 is a = r / sin \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the cutting plane and the axis.\n\nEarlier, I calculated sin \u03b8 = 3/5, so a = 6 / (3/5) = 10.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the area is 60\u03c0, which doesn't match the problem's form.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area differently.\n\nWait, another approach: The cross-section is a flat face on each half, which is a planar region. So, to find its area, I can find the shape of the cross-section.\n\nGiven that the plane passes through A, B, and the center, the cross-section is a region bounded by two lines from A and B to the top of the cylinder.\n\nWait, actually, when you slice the cylinder along the plane, the cross-section will be a region that is a rectangle or a parallelogram, but in 3D, it's a flat face.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a trapezoid or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, let me think about the intersection curve. The plane intersects the cylinder along an ellipse, but when you slice the cylinder, the face is the part of the plane inside the cylinder.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is the intersection curve, but the face is the flat surface on each half, which is the cross-section.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area can be found by considering the height and the angle.\n\nWait, the cross-section is an ellipse with major axis 10 and minor axis 6, area 60\u03c0. But the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that both a and b are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape, such as a rectangle or a parallelogram, with both curved and straight edges? Wait, no, the cross-section of a plane cutting a cylinder is either an ellipse, circle, or pair of lines (if parallel to the side).\n\nWait, but in this case, the plane is not parallel to the side, nor is it perpendicular, so it must be an ellipse.\n\nTherefore, the area is 60\u03c0, but the problem says it's a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that the area has both \u03c0 and \u221ac terms. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is not just the ellipse but also includes some rectangular areas? Wait, no, the cross-section is a single face.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area of the intersection curve on the surface of the cylinder, but that seems more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape because the plane passes through the center.\n\nWait, another thought: The cross-section is actually a rectangle with length equal to the height of the cylinder and width equal to the chord length AB, but since the plane is at an angle, the area is not just length times width, but adjusted by some factor.\n\nWait, chord AB is 6\u221a3, height is 8. If the cross-section is a parallelogram, then the area is base times height, where base is 6\u221a3 and height is 8, but adjusted by the angle.\n\nWait, but the height in the parallelogram is not the same as the height of the cylinder. It's the height perpendicular to the base.\n\nWait, the angle between the plane and the base is such that sin \u03b8 = 3/5, as before. So, the height of the parallelogram would be 8 / sin \u03b8 = 8 / (3/5) = 40/3.\n\nBut then the area would be base * height = 6\u221a3 * (40/3) = 80\u221a3.\n\nBut that's a pure multiple of \u221a3, which again doesn't fit the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the area is a combination of a rectangle and a triangle or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area by finding the coordinates of the cross-section and then using the shoelace formula or something.\n\nWait, let me try to find the coordinates of the cross-section.\n\nThe plane intersects the cylinder along the ellipse, which we can parametrize as:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4\n\nBut to find the area, perhaps I can compute the surface integral over the cross-section.\n\nWait, but since it's an ellipse, the area is \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-axes.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought a = 10 and b = 6, giving 60\u03c0. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the major and minor axes differently.\n\nWait, another way: The major axis is the length of the intersection curve in the direction where the plane is \"most sloped,\" and the minor axis is perpendicular.\n\nAlternatively, the area can be found using the formula:\n\nArea = (2\u03c0r^2) / sqrt(A^2 + B^2 + C^2)\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is equal to the area of the base circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the base.\n\nWait, the angle between the plane and the base can be found by the normal vector of the plane.\n\nThe normal vector of the base is (0,0,1). The normal vector of the cutting plane is (4,0,-3). The angle between the normals is given by the dot product:\n\ncos \u03c6 = (0*4 + 0*0 + 1*(-3)) / (|normal1| |normal2|) = (-3)/5.\n\nSo, the angle between the planes is 90\u00b0 - \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle between the normals.\n\nSo, the angle \u03b8 between the cutting plane and the base is arccos(3/5).\n\nTherefore, the area of the cross-section is the area of the base circle divided by cos \u03b8.\n\nArea = (\u03c0r^2) / cos \u03b8 = (\u03c0*36) / (3/5) = (36\u03c0)*(5/3) = 60\u03c0.\n\nAgain, same result. So, it must be 60\u03c0, but the problem says it's a\u03c0 + b\u221ac.\n\nWait, maybe the area is not just the cross-section but includes something else.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces.\" So, each half of the cylinder will have an unpainted face, which is the cross-section.\n\nBut perhaps the cross-section isn't just the ellipse but also includes some rectangular areas where the plane intersects the top and bottom faces.\n\nWait, no, the plane passes through the center, so it intersects the top and bottom faces at points A and B.\n\nWait, actually, no, because A and B are on the bottom face, but the plane also passes through the center, which is on the axis. So, the plane would intersect the top face as well at some points.\n\nWait, let me think. The plane passes through A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0), and O(0,0,4). So, it goes from A and B on the bottom to the center O. Does it intersect the top face?\n\nThe top face is at z=8. Let's see if the plane intersects z=8.\n\nFrom the plane equation 4x - 3z = -12, when z=8, 4x - 24 = -12 --> 4x = 12 --> x=3.\n\nSo, at z=8, the plane intersects the top face at x=3, y can be anything such that x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36. So, y\u00b2 = 36 - 9 = 27, so y = \u00b13\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the plane intersects the top face at points (3, 3\u221a3, 8) and (3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nSo, the cross-section is a quadrilateral with vertices at A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), O(0,0,4), and the two top points (3, 3\u221a3, 8) and (3, -3\u221a3, 8). Wait, no, actually, the cross-section is a polygon connecting A, B, and the two top points.\n\nWait, no, because the plane slices through the cylinder, so the cross-section is a closed curve. From the bottom, it goes from A to B, then up through the center O, and then to the top points.\n\nWait, no, actually, the cross-section is a polygon with four points: A, B, and the two top intersection points.\n\nWait, but in reality, the cross-section is a four-sided figure: two points on the bottom, two points on the top, connected by edges.\n\nSo, the cross-section is a trapezoid or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, connecting A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0) to (3, 3\u221a3, 8), and B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0) to (3, -3\u221a3, 8). So, it's a parallelogram.\n\nYes, because the sides are parallel. The sides from A to (3, 3\u221a3, 8) and from B to (3, -3\u221a3, 8) are both moving in the same direction.\n\nSo, the cross-section is a parallelogram with vertices at A, B, (3, 3\u221a3, 8), and (3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nTherefore, to find the area of this parallelogram, we can compute the magnitude of the cross product of two adjacent sides.\n\nLet me define vectors for two adjacent sides.\n\nTake point A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0). The two adjacent sides are from A to B and from A to (3, 3\u221a3, 8).\n\nWait, no, actually, the sides are from A to B and from A to (3, 3\u221a3, 8). Wait, no, in a parallelogram, the sides are from A to B and from A to the top point.\n\nWait, no, actually, the cross-section is a parallelogram with sides from A to (3, 3\u221a3, 8) and from B to (3, -3\u221a3, 8). Wait, maybe it's better to compute vectors in the plane.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a parallelogram, the area can be found by the base times height.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use vectors.\n\nLet me compute vectors along two edges from point A.\n\nVector AB: from A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0) to B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0): (0, -6\u221a3, 0).\n\nVector AD: from A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0) to D(3, 3\u221a3, 8): (6, 0, 8).\n\nThen, the area is the magnitude of the cross product of AB and AD.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AD:\n\nAB = (0, -6\u221a3, 0)\n\nAD = (6, 0, 8)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|0 -6\u221a3 0|\n|6 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a08|\n\n= i*(-6\u221a3*8 - 0*0) - j*(0*8 - 0*6) + k*(0*0 - (-6\u221a3)*6)\n\n= i*(-48\u221a3) - j*(0) + k*(36\u221a3)\n\n= (-48\u221a3, 0, 36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt[ (-48\u221a3)^2 + 0^2 + (36\u221a3)^2 ].\n\nCalculate:\n\n(-48\u221a3)^2 = 48^2 * 3 = 2304 * 3 = 6912\n\n(36\u221a3)^2 = 36^2 * 3 = 1296 * 3 = 3888\n\nSo, total is 6912 + 3888 = 10800\n\nsqrt(10800) = sqrt(100*108) = 10*sqrt(108) = 10*sqrt(36*3) = 10*6*sqrt(3) = 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is 60\u221a3.\n\nWait, but according to this, the area is 60\u221a3, which is in the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3, so a + b + c = 63.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the cross-section was an ellipse with area 60\u03c0, but now, by considering the cross-section as a parallelogram, I get 60\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests both terms are present. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider both the ellipse and the parallelogram? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, actually, when you slice the cylinder, the cross-section is both an ellipse and a parallelogram? No, that can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 8, but that would give area 48\u221a3, which is different.\n\nWait, no, according to the vector cross product, the area is 60\u221a3. So, why did I think it was an ellipse earlier?\n\nBecause the intersection of a plane and a cylinder is generally an ellipse, but in this case, since the plane passes through the center, it might create a cross-section that is a parallelogram.\n\nWait, actually, the cross-section is a planar figure, which is a parallelogram because the plane intersects both the top and bottom faces of the cylinder.\n\nWait, but the intersection of the plane with the cylinder's surface is an ellipse, but the cross-section of the solid is a parallelogram.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify: the problem says the block is sliced in half along the plane, revealing an unpainted face. The unpainted face is the cross-section of the plane with the cylinder, which is an ellipse. But according to the vector calculation, the area is 60\u221a3, which is a parallelogram.\n\nWait, but I think I might be confusing the cross-section of the surface with the cross-section of the solid.\n\nWait, when you slice the cylinder along the plane, the resulting face is the intersection of the plane with the cylinder. Since the plane passes through the center, the intersection is an ellipse, but the area of the face is the area of the ellipse.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the area as 60\u03c0, but the problem says it's a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that the area has both \u03c0 and \u221ac terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape because the plane passes through the center.\n\nWait, let me think again. The intersection of the plane with the cylinder is an ellipse, but the problem is about the area of the face on each half, which is the cross-section.\n\nBut according to the Asymptote code, it seems like the cross-section is a flat face with some curves, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area differently. Maybe the cross-section is a combination of a rectangle and a curved part.\n\nWait, but in reality, the cross-section is a planar figure, so it must be a flat shape. Therefore, it's either an ellipse or a parallelogram.\n\nBut according to the vector cross product, the area is 60\u221a3, which is a parallelogram. But according to the parametrization, it's an ellipse with area 60\u03c0.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to resolve this confusion.\n\nLet me think: The cross-section of the cylinder by a plane is an ellipse, but when you slice the solid cylinder along the plane, the resulting face is the same as the cross-section of the surface, which is an ellipse. Therefore, the area should be that of the ellipse.\n\nBut according to the vector calculation, treating the cross-section as a parallelogram, I get 60\u221a3.\n\nBut which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me compute the area using both methods.\n\nFirst, using the ellipse method:\n\nWe found that the semi-major axis is 10 and semi-minor axis is 6, so area is 60\u03c0.\n\nSecond, using the parallelogram method:\n\nVectors AB and AD give cross product magnitude 60\u221a3.\n\nBut which one is the correct area?\n\nWait, perhaps both are correct, but they represent different things.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section of the cylinder is an ellipse, so the area should be 60\u03c0. However, the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests both \u03c0 and \u221ac are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the cross-section.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is not a simple ellipse but a more complex shape because the plane passes through the center.\n\nWait, actually, when a plane passes through the center of a cylinder, the cross-section is a rectangle if the plane is perpendicular to the axis, or an ellipse otherwise.\n\nBut in our case, the plane is not perpendicular, so it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, but according to the Asymptote code, it seems like the cross-section is a flat face with some curves, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area by integrating.\n\nLet me parameterize the ellipse.\n\nFrom earlier, the parametrization is:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4\n\nSo, to find the area, we can compute the surface area of this parametrization.\n\nThe formula for the surface area of a parametric surface is:\n\nArea = \u222b\u222b |r_\u03b8 \u00d7 r_\u03c6| d\u03b8 d\u03c6\n\nBut in this case, it's a 1D curve, so that's not applicable.\n\nWait, no, actually, the cross-section is a curve, not a surface. So, the area is that of the ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area using the parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, since the cross-section is an ellipse, we can compute its area by finding the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors defining the ellipse.\n\nWait, in the plane 4x - 3z = -12, we can define a coordinate system.\n\nLet me choose two orthonormal vectors lying on the plane.\n\nFirst, find two direction vectors on the plane.\n\nFrom the plane equation 4x - 3z = -12, the direction vectors can be found by setting variables.\n\nLet me set y = 0, then the plane equation becomes 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nSo, one direction vector can be found by setting x = t, z = (4t + 12)/3.\n\nSo, vector v1 = (1, 0, 4/3).\n\nAnother direction vector can be found by setting z = 0, then 4x = -12 --> x = -3. So, direction vector v2 = (0, t, 0). Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, to find another direction vector, set x = 0, then -3z = -12 --> z=4. So, direction vector v2 = (0, t, 4/t). Wait, no, that's not a direction vector.\n\nWait, perhaps better to find vectors in the plane.\n\nSince the plane is 4x - 3z = -12, we can find two orthonormal vectors.\n\nFirst, let me find two direction vectors:\n\nLet\u2019s set x = t, then z = (4t + 12)/3. So, one vector is (1, 0, 4/3).\n\nAnother vector can be found by setting z = t, then x = (3t - 12)/4. So, another vector is ((3/4), 0, 1).\n\nBut these vectors are not necessarily orthogonal.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the cross product.\n\nWe have the normal vector n = (4, 0, -3). Let me find two orthonormal vectors in the plane.\n\nFirst, choose a vector not parallel to n. Let's choose e1 = (1, 0, 0). Then, project e1 onto the plane.\n\nWait, the projection of e1 onto the plane is e1 minus the component in the normal direction.\n\nThe component of e1 in the normal direction is (e1 \u2022 n / |n|\u00b2) * n.\n\nCompute e1 \u2022 n = 4.\n\n|n|\u00b2 = 16 + 0 + 9 = 25.\n\nSo, the projection is e1 - (4/25) * n = (1, 0, 0) - (4/25)(4, 0, -3) = (1 - 16/25, 0, 0 + 12/25) = (9/25, 0, 12/25).\n\nThis is a vector in the plane. Let's call it v1 = (9/25, 0, 12/25).\n\nNow, find another vector v2 orthogonal to v1.\n\nTake e2 = (0, 1, 0). Project e2 onto the plane.\n\nCompute e2 \u2022 n = 0.\n\nSo, the projection is e2 - (0/25)*n = e2.\n\nBut e2 is (0,1,0), which is orthogonal to n, so it lies on the plane.\n\nBut we need v2 orthogonal to v1.\n\nCompute v1 \u2022 e2 = 0, since v1 has no y-component.\n\nSo, e2 is already orthogonal to v1.\n\nBut we need to normalize these vectors.\n\nCompute |v1| = sqrt( (9/25)^2 + (12/25)^2 ) = sqrt(81 + 144)/25 = sqrt(225)/25 = 15/25 = 3/5.\n\nSo, normalize v1: u1 = (9/25)/(3/5), 0, (12/25)/(3/5)) = ( (9/25)*(5/3), 0, (12/25)*(5/3) ) = ( 3/5, 0, 4/5 ).\n\nSimilarly, |e2| = 1, so u2 = (0,1,0).\n\nNow, we have an orthonormal basis {u1, u2} in the plane.\n\nNow, the parametrization of the ellipse can be written as:\n\nr(\u03b8) = center + a*u1*cos\u03b8 + b*u2*sin\u03b8\n\nWait, but in our case, the ellipse is not centered at the origin but at the center of the cylinder, which is (0,0,4).\n\nWait, no, the ellipse is the intersection curve, which is centered where?\n\nWait, the intersection curve is an ellipse, but its center is not necessarily the center of the cylinder.\n\nWait, actually, the ellipse is centered at the point where the plane intersects the cylinder's axis. The cylinder's axis is the z-axis, so the plane intersects the z-axis at (0,0, z) where 4*0 - 3z = -12 --> z=4.\n\nSo, the center of the ellipse is at (0,0,4).\n\nTherefore, the parametrization of the ellipse is:\n\nr(\u03b8) = (0,0,4) + a*u1*cos\u03b8 + b*u2*sin\u03b8\n\nBut we need to find a and b.\n\nWait, but in our case, the ellipse is the intersection of the plane with the cylinder, so the parametrization is:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4\n\nBut we can express this in terms of the orthonormal basis.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute the area using the parametrization.\n\nThe area of the ellipse can be computed by the integral over \u03b8 of |r\u2019(\u03b8) \u00d7 r''(\u03b8)| d\u03b8 / 2, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the parametrization, we can compute the area using the formula for parametric surfaces.\n\nWait, but it's a 1D curve, so that's not applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area by finding the major and minor axes.\n\nEarlier, I thought the semi-major axis is 10 and semi-minor is 6, but that gave 60\u03c0, which didn't fit the problem's form.\n\nBut according to the vector cross product, treating the cross-section as a parallelogram, the area is 60\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests both terms are present.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a combination of a rectangle and a curved part, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area differently.\n\nWait, another approach: The cross-section is an ellipse, but the area can also be computed as the length of the intersection curve times the width, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the area by computing the integral of the circumference.\n\nWait, no, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, another thought: The area of the cross-section can be found by the product of the circumference of the base and the height, but that's the lateral surface area, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, I'm stuck between two results: 60\u03c0 and 60\u221a3.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that both \u03c0 and \u221ac are present. Therefore, my previous assumption that it's a pure ellipse with area 60\u03c0 is wrong.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape, such as a parallelogram with an area of 60\u221a3.\n\nBut how does that reconcile with the initial thought that it's an ellipse?\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with length equal to the chord AB and height equal to the height of the cylinder, but adjusted by the angle.\n\nWait, chord AB is 6\u221a3, height is 8, but the angle between the plane and the base is such that sin \u03b8 = 3/5.\n\nTherefore, the area is 6\u221a3 * 8 / (3/5) = 6\u221a3 * (40/3) = 80\u221a3.\n\nBut that's different from 60\u221a3.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area differently.\n\nWait, another way: The cross-section is a parallelogram with sides of length equal to the chord AB and the height of the cylinder, but inclined at an angle.\n\nWait, the sides are AB = 6\u221a3 and the height from AB to the top, which is 8, but adjusted by the angle.\n\nWait, the area of the parallelogram is base * height, where base is AB = 6\u221a3, and height is the distance from the plane to the top along the direction perpendicular to AB.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the formula for the area of a parallelogram: |a \u00d7 b|, where a and b are vectors.\n\nEarlier, I computed vectors AB and AD, and their cross product gave 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area is 60\u221a3.\n\nSo, according to this, the area is 60\u221a3, which is in the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3, so a + b + c = 63.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that both a and b are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a combination of a rectangle and a curved part, but I don't see how.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 8, but then the area would be 48\u221a3, which is still not matching.\n\nWait, but according to the vector cross product, it's 60\u221a3.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption that the cross-section is a parallelogram is correct, and the area is 60\u221a3, which is in the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3, so a + b + c = 63.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests both terms are present, but in this case, a=0.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is a combination of a rectangle and a semicircle or something else.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a flat face, so it's a planar figure, which is a parallelogram.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct area is 60\u221a3, so a + b + c = 63.\n\nBut in the initial attempt, the person thought it was 60\u221a3 and got 63, but the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests both terms are present.\n\nTherefore, I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a different shape.\n\nWait, another approach: The cross-section is a rectangle with length equal to the height of the cylinder and width equal to the chord length AB, but inclined at an angle.\n\nWait, so the area would be length * width / cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the base.\n\nEarlier, we found cos \u03b8 = 3/5, so area = 6\u221a3 * 8 / (3/5) = 6\u221a3 * 40/3 = 80\u221a3.\n\nBut that's still only a \u221ac term.\n\nWait, but the problem says a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so perhaps the cross-section is a combination of a rectangle and a semicircle.\n\nWait, but no, the cross-section is a planar figure.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a sector of a circle plus a rectangle.\n\nWait, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the cross-section is a rhombus, which has an area that can be expressed in terms of \u03c0 and \u221ac.\n\nBut I don't see how.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area using the parametrization.\n\nGiven the parametrization:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4\n\nWe can compute the area using the formula for the area of a parametric curve, but that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, no, actually, the cross-section is a curve, so the area is that of the ellipse, which is 60\u03c0.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that both terms are present.\n\nTherefore, I think that the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with length 8 and width equal to the chord AB, 6\u221a3, but that would be 48\u221a3.\n\nWait, but the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so maybe it's the sum of a rectangle and a semicircle.\n\nWait, but the cross-section is a planar figure, so it's either a rectangle, parallelogram, or ellipse.\n\nWait, I think I need to accept that the cross-section is a parallelogram with area 60\u221a3, which is in the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3, so a + b + c = 63.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 63.\n\nBut in the initial attempt, the person got 63, but the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests both terms are non-zero. So, maybe the correct answer is 63.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a combination of a rectangle and a triangle, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the cross-section is a sector of a circle with radius equal to the slant height.\n\nWait, the slant height can be found by the distance from A to the top intersection point.\n\nDistance from A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0) to (3, 3\u221a3, 8):\n\n\u0394x = 6, \u0394y = 0, \u0394z = 8.\n\nSo, distance = sqrt(6\u00b2 + 8\u00b2) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10.\n\nSo, the slant height is 10.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a sector with radius 10 and angle 120 degrees, but that's a 2D sector.\n\nWait, but in 3D, it's a kind of conical section.\n\nWait, but the cross-section is planar, so it's a flat figure.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a triangle with base AB and two sides of length 10.\n\nBut AB is 6\u221a3, and the two sides are 10 each.\n\nSo, the area would be (base * height)/2.\n\nBut base is 6\u221a3, and height can be found by the angle.\n\nWait, with sides 10, 10, and base 6\u221a3.\n\nUsing Heron's formula:\n\ns = (10 + 10 + 6\u221a3)/2 = 10 + 3\u221a3\n\nArea = sqrt( s(s - 10)(s - 10)(s - 6\u221a3) )\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for area = (1/2)*ab*sin\u03b8, where a and b are sides, and \u03b8 is the angle between them.\n\nHere, a = b = 10, \u03b8 is the angle opposite the base 6\u221a3.\n\nUsing the law of cosines:\n\n(6\u221a3)^2 = 10^2 + 10^2 - 2*10*10*cos\u03b8\n\n108 = 100 + 100 - 200 cos\u03b8\n\n108 = 200 - 200 cos\u03b8\n\n200 cos\u03b8 = 200 - 108 = 92\n\ncos\u03b8 = 92/200 = 23/50\n\nTherefore, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(1 - (23/50)^2) = sqrt(1 - 529/2500) = sqrt(1971/2500) = sqrt(1971)/50.\n\nTherefore, area = (1/2)*10*10*(sqrt(1971)/50) = (100/2)*(sqrt(1971)/50) = 50*(sqrt(1971)/50) = sqrt(1971).\n\nBut 1971 factors into 9*219 = 9*3*73, so sqrt(1971) = 3\u221a219. Therefore, area = 3\u221a219.\n\nBut that doesn't fit the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac with c square-free, since 219 = 3*73, which is square-free. So, area = 3\u221a219, which is in the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=3, c=219, so a + b + c = 222.\n\nBut that contradicts the previous result.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. I think I need to stick with the initial approach.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the correct answer is 63, as the cross-section is a parallelogram with area 60\u221a3.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves slicing a cylinder along a plane passing through two points on its base and its center, revealing an unpainted face.

          "reasoning": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this AIME problem about a cylinder that's been sliced, and I need to find the area of the newly exposed face. Let me go through my thoughts step by step.\n\nFirst, the cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 8. The entire surface is painted blue. Points A and B are on the edge of one of the circular faces, and the arc AB measures 120 degrees. The block is then sliced in half along a plane passing through A, B, and the center of the cylinder. This slicing reveals an unpainted face on each half, and I need to find the area of one of these faces.\n\nIn my previous attempts, I considered whether the cross-section would be an ellipse, a rectangle, a parallelogram, or a trapezoid. Initially, I thought it might be an ellipse, but then realized that because the plane passes through the center, the cross-section might be a different shape.\n\nWait, actually, when you slice a cylinder with a plane that passes through its central axis, the cross-section is usually a rectangle. But in this case, the plane isn't just passing through the central axis; it's also passing through two points A and B on the circumference of the base, which are 120 degrees apart. So, maybe it's not a rectangle but another shape.\n\nLet me think about how the plane intersects the cylinder. The cylinder is a right circular cylinder, so its cross-section when sliced by a plane not perpendicular to the axis can be an ellipse, but in this case, since the plane goes through the center, maybe it's a different kind of figure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a parallelogram. Because the plane is slicing through the cylinder and passing through two points on the circular face, it might create a slanted face. The intersection of the plane with the cylinder's surface would form an ellipse, but the flat, unpainted face is actually the intersection of the slicing plane with the cylinder's interior. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the exterior and interior here.\n\nWait, the problem says that the block is sliced in half along the plane passing through A, B, and the center. So, the resulting face is a flat, unpainted face. So, this face is part of the plane that slices through the cylinder. So, I need to find the area of this flat, unpainted face.\n\nSince the cylinder is a right circular cylinder, the plane slices through it, and the intersection of the plane with the cylinder will form an ellipse. But wait, the area of the unpainted face is not the area of the ellipse but the area of the flat, newly exposed face. Hmm, that might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the shape of the slice. If the plane passes through A, B, and the center, the intersection with the cylinder will create a flat face which is a portion of the plane. So, maybe the shape is a rectangle or a parallelogram.\n\nLet me consider the points A and B. The arc AB is 120 degrees on the circular face. So, the chord AB subtends a 120-degree angle at the center of the circle. The length of chord AB can be found using the formula for chord length: chord length = 2r sin(theta/2). So, with r = 6 and theta = 120 degrees, chord AB is 2*6*sin(60\u00b0) = 12*(\u221a3/2) = 6\u221a3.\n\nSo, the chord AB is 6\u221a3 in length. Now, points A and B are on the circumference of the circular face, and the plane passes through A, B, and the center of the cylinder. So, the plane is determined by these three points.\n\nSince the cylinder has height 8, the center is 4 units from the top and bottom along the axis. So, the plane slices through the cylinder, creating a flat face on each half. I need to find the area of this face.\n\nWait, maybe I can model the cylinder in a coordinate system. Let's set the center of the circular face at the origin (0,0,0), with the cylinder extending along the z-axis from z = 0 to z = 8. Then, the circular face is in the plane z = 0, with radius 6.\n\nPoints A and B are on the circumference of this circular face. Since the arc AB is 120 degrees, we can place point A at (6, 0, 0). Then, point B will be 120 degrees around the circle, which would be at (6 cos 120\u00b0, 6 sin 120\u00b0, 0). Calculating that, cos 120\u00b0 is -1/2, and sin 120\u00b0 is \u221a3/2, so point B is at (6*(-1/2), 6*(\u221a3/2), 0) = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nWait, but in the Asymptote code provided, the points A and B are at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) and (-3, -3\u221a3, 0), respectively. Hmm, so maybe point A is at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) and point B is at (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). So, the arc AB is 120 degrees as well.\n\nWait, but if A is at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) and B is at (-3, -3\u221a3, 0), then the angle between them is 120 degrees because the angle between the vectors from the center to A and B is 120 degrees. Let me confirm:\n\nThe vector from the center (0,0,0) to A is (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and to B is (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). The dot product of these vectors is (-3)*(-3) + (3\u221a3)*(-3\u221a3) + 0*0 = 9 - 27 + 0 = -18.\n\nThe magnitude of each vector is sqrt((-3)^2 + (3\u221a3)^2) = sqrt(9 + 27) = sqrt(36) = 6. So, the dot product is |A||B|cos(theta) = 6*6*cos(theta) = 36 cos(theta). We have 36 cos(theta) = -18, so cos(theta) = -18/36 = -1/2, which implies theta = 120 degrees. Perfect, that matches the problem statement.\n\nSo, points A and B are at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) and (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). The plane passes through A, B, and the center (0,0,0). So, this plane is the same as the plane passing through points (0,0,0), (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and (-3, -3\u221a3, 0).\n\nWait, but in 3D, the plane will also extend along the height of the cylinder. So, it's not just the base but also goes through the top. So, when we slice the cylinder with this plane, the intersection will form a shape.\n\nBut I need to find the area of the flat, unpainted face. This face is the portion of the slicing plane that cuts through the cylinder. So, it's a quadrilateral, perhaps? Or maybe a triangle?\n\nWait, actually, since the plane passes through two points on the base, A and B, and the center, which is on the axis, the plane will also pass through the top of the cylinder. Let me check: if the center is at (0,0,4), wait, no, the center of the cylinder is at (0,0,4), since the height is 8. Wait, no, actually, the cylinder is from z=0 to z=8, so the center is at (0,0,4). Wait, but the plane passes through (0,0,0), A, and B, but does it pass through the center at (0,0,4)?\n\nWait, hold on, the problem says the plane passes through A, B, and the center of the cylinder. So, the center of the cylinder is at (0,0,4). So, the plane passes through (0,0,4), (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). So, that defines the plane.\n\nSo, to find the equation of the plane, we can use these three points. Let's denote them as P1 = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), P2 = (-3, -3\u221a3, 0), and P3 = (0, 0, 4).\n\nFirst, let's find two vectors in the plane. Vector P1P3 = (0 - (-3), 0 - 3\u221a3, 4 - 0) = (3, -3\u221a3, 4). Vector P2P3 = (0 - (-3), 0 - (-3\u221a3), 4 - 0) = (3, 3\u221a3, 4).\n\nNow, to find the normal vector to the plane, we can take the cross product of these two vectors.\n\nLet me compute the cross product of P1P3 and P2P3.\n\nLet vector v = (3, -3\u221a3, 4) and vector w = (3, 3\u221a3, 4).\n\nThe cross product v \u00d7 w is:\n\n|i     j         k|\n|3  -3\u221a3      4|\n|3   3\u221a3      4|\n\n= i [(-3\u221a3)(4) - (4)(3\u221a3)] - j [(3)(4) - (4)(3)] + k [(3)(3\u221a3) - (-3\u221a3)(3)]\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni component: (-3\u221a3 * 4) - (4 * 3\u221a3) = (-12\u221a3) - (12\u221a3) = -24\u221a3\n\nj component: -( (3*4) - (4*3) ) = -(12 - 12) = -0 = 0\n\nk component: (3*3\u221a3) - (-3\u221a3*3) = 9\u221a3 - (-9\u221a3) = 9\u221a3 + 9\u221a3 = 18\u221a3\n\nSo, the cross product is (-24\u221a3, 0, 18\u221a3). We can simplify this by dividing by 6: (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3). So, the normal vector is (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3).\n\nTherefore, the equation of the plane can be written as:\n\n-4\u221a3(x - x0) + 0(y - y0) + 3\u221a3(z - z0) = 0\n\nUsing point P3 (0,0,4) as (x0, y0, z0):\n\n-4\u221a3(x - 0) + 0(y - 0) + 3\u221a3(z - 4) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-4\u221a3 x + 3\u221a3 z - 12\u221a3 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a3:\n\n-4x + 3z - 12 = 0\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is -4x + 3z = 12, or 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nNow, the intersection of this plane with the cylinder will form the boundary of the unpainted face. The unpainted face is a flat surface, so it's a portion of this plane within the cylinder.\n\nTo find the area of this face, I need to determine the shape of the intersection. Since the plane cuts through the cylinder, the intersection should be an ellipse, but since the plane passes through the center, maybe it's a different shape.\n\nWait, actually, the intersection of a plane with a cylinder can result in an ellipse, a circle, or a pair of lines (if the plane is tangent or parallel). But in this case, the plane is cutting through the cylinder at an angle, so the intersection curve is an ellipse. However, the \"unpainted face\" is the flat surface on each half of the cylinder after slicing. So, each half has a flat face which is part of the plane we just found.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is a rectangle or a parallelogram? Because the slicing plane intersects the cylinder along a closed curve, but the face on each half would be a portion of that curve.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a rectangle. Let me think. The plane passes through points A, B, and the center. So, on the circular face, the plane intersects the circumference at A and B. Along the height of the cylinder, the plane will intersect the top and bottom circular faces as well.\n\nWait, but the top circular face is at z=8, and the plane equation is 4x - 3z = -12. Let me find where this plane intersects the top face z=8.\n\nAt z=8, the equation becomes 4x - 3*8 = -12 => 4x -24 = -12 => 4x = 12 => x=3.\n\nSo, on the top face, the plane intersects at (3, y, 8). But since the top face is a circle of radius 6, we can find y.\n\nFrom the plane equation, at z=8, x=3, so plug into the cylinder's equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 6\u00b2.\n\nSo, 3\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36 => 9 + y\u00b2 = 36 => y\u00b2=27 => y=\u00b13\u221a3.\n\nSo, the plane intersects the top face at (3, 3\u221a3, 8) and (3, -3\u221a3, 8). Similarly, on the bottom face at z=0, the plane intersects at points A and B: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) and (-3, -3\u221a3, 0).\n\nSo, the slicing plane intersects the cylinder along four points: two on the bottom face (A and B) and two on the top face (let's call them C and D: (3, 3\u221a3, 8) and (3, -3\u221a3, 8)).\n\nTherefore, the intersection curve is a quadrilateral with vertices at A, B, C, D.\n\nWait, so the flat, unpainted face on each half of the cylinder is a quadrilateral. So, each half has a face which is a triangle or a quadrilateral?\n\nWait, when you slice the cylinder along the plane, each half will have a face that is a portion of the plane. Since the plane intersects the cylinder along a quadrilateral, each half will have a triangular face? Or maybe a trapezoid?\n\nWait, actually, each half will have a face that is a triangle. Because when you slice through the cylinder, each half will have a face bounded by the plane and the original surface. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the entire intersection of the plane with the cylinder is a quadrilateral, so each half of the cylinder will have half of that quadrilateral as its unpainted face. So, each unpainted face is a triangle? Or perhaps a trapezoid.\n\nWait, actually, no. When you slice the cylinder along the plane, each half will have a face that is a portion of the plane. Since the plane intersects the cylinder at four points, the intersection is a quadrilateral, but each half of the cylinder will have two of those points on their face.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each half has a face that is a triangle. Let me try to visualize.\n\nImagine the cylinder standing vertically. The slicing plane goes through points A and B on the bottom, and points C and D on the top. So, the intersection is a quadrilateral ABCD. Then, each half of the cylinder will have a face that is a triangle, either connecting A, B, C, or something else. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the unpainted face is a rectangle or a parallelogram. Let me check the coordinates of the intersection points.\n\nWe have points A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0), C(3, 3\u221a3, 8), and D(3, -3\u221a3, 8). So, the quadrilateral is A-B-D-C-A.\n\nSo, this is a trapezoid because AB and CD are both horizontal lines on the cylinder's circular faces, but AD and BC are slant edges.\n\nWait, actually, in 3D, the sides AB and CD are not necessarily parallel. Let me check.\n\nWait, AB is from (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) to (-3, -3\u221a3, 0), which is a vertical line on the bottom face. Similarly, CD is from (3, 3\u221a3, 8) to (3, -3\u221a3, 8), which is a vertical line on the top face.\n\nSo, AB and CD are both vertical lines on their respective circular faces, but since the cylinder is circular, they are not parallel in 3D space. Wait, actually, in 3D, vertical lines on different circular faces (top and bottom) are parallel if they are aligned along the same axis. But since AB is on the bottom face and CD is on the top face, and the cylinder is straight, AB and CD are parallel because they both are vertical along the z-axis direction.\n\nWait, no. AB is from (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) to (-3, -3\u221a3, 0), which is a straight line on the bottom face, but in 3D, this is a vertical line segment. Similarly, CD is from (3, 3\u221a3, 8) to (3, -3\u221a3, 8), which is another vertical line segment on the top face. So, in 3D, these are two vertical lines, but they are not parallel because they are offset in the x-direction. So, they are skew lines? Or do they lie on the same plane?\n\nWait, actually, all four points lie on the slicing plane, so AB and CD are both on the same plane. Therefore, AB and CD must be parallel because they are both on the same plane and are both vertical in their respective circular faces. Wait, but in 3D, vertical lines on different circular faces can be non-parallel unless they are aligned.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the shape. The quadrilateral ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, and DA.\n\nAB is from A to B, which is a vertical line on the bottom face. BC is from B to C, which is a diagonal line from (-3, -3\u221a3, 0) to (3, 3\u221a3, 8). CD is from C to D, which is a vertical line on the top face. DA is from D to A, which is a diagonal line from (3, -3\u221a3, 8) to (-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nSo, sides BC and DA are diagonals, while AB and CD are vertical.\n\nTherefore, the quadrilateral ABCD is a trapezoid because AB and CD are both vertical (and hence parallel), and BC and DA are the non-parallel sides.\n\nBut in 3D, the trapezoid is not necessarily planar, but in this case, all four points lie on the slicing plane, so it's a planar trapezoid.\n\nWait, but in reality, the intersection of a plane with a cylinder is an ellipse, but in this case, since the plane passes through the center, it's a different kind of curve.\n\nWait, maybe it's a rectangle? Because the plane slices through the cylinder symmetrically. Hmm, but the sides are not necessarily at right angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a parallelogram. If the sides BC and DA are equal and parallel, then ABCD is a parallelogram.\n\nLet me check the vectors for BC and DA.\n\nVector BC is from B to C: (3 - (-3), 3\u221a3 - (-3\u221a3), 8 - 0) = (6, 6\u221a3, 8).\n\nVector DA is from D to A: (-3 - 3, 3\u221a3 - (-3\u221a3), 0 - 8) = (-6, 6\u221a3, -8).\n\nSo, vector BC is (6, 6\u221a3, 8), and vector DA is (-6, 6\u221a3, -8). These are not equal, but they are negatives of each other in the x-component and z-component but same in y-component. So, they are not equal vectors, so BC and DA are not equal and parallel. So, it's not a parallelogram.\n\nWait, but in the slicing plane, the figure ABCD is a trapezoid because AB and CD are both vertical and hence parallel, but the other sides are not parallel.\n\nBut in 3D, the sides BC and DA are not necessarily parallel, so the figure is a trapezoid.\n\nBut I need to find the area of the unpainted face. Since the slicing plane divides the cylinder into two halves, each half has a face which is a portion of the slicing plane. So, each face is a triangle? Or is it a trapezoid?\n\nWait, the entire slicing plane intersects the cylinder along the quadrilateral ABCD, which is a trapezoid. So, each half of the cylinder will have half of this trapezoid as its unpainted face.\n\nWait, no. When you slice the cylinder along the plane ABCD, each half will have a face that is a triangle. Because the plane cuts through the cylinder, creating two congruent halves, each half will have a triangular face with vertices at A, B, and the center, or something else?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the slicing plane passes through A, B, and the center. So, the intersection with the cylinder is the quadrilateral ABCD. So, each half of the cylinder will have a face that is a triangle. For example, one half will have the face connecting A, B, and the center, and the other half will have the face connecting C, D, and the center. But in reality, the center is at (0,0,4), so the face on each half is a triangle with vertices at A, B, and the center, or C, D, and the center.\n\nWait, but the center is inside the cylinder, so each half will have a triangular face. Hmm, perhaps.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The slicing plane passes through points A, B, and the center. So, when you cut the cylinder with this plane, each half will have a face that is a triangle formed by A, B, and the center. But since the center is a point, the face is a triangle.\n\nBut wait, the center is a single point, so each half would have a triangular face with vertices at A, B, and the center. But that seems too simple because the problem mentions the area is in the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests a combination of circular and square roots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the unpainted face is a rectangle or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, maybe I should parameterize the intersection curve.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the unpainted face is a rectangle with length equal to the height of the cylinder and width equal to the distance between A and B along the plane.\n\nWait, but the distance between A and B is 6\u221a3 as we found earlier. The height is 8, but since the plane is slanting, the actual area would be something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is the length of the intersection curve multiplied by the height. But the intersection curve is an ellipse, so its length is the circumference of the ellipse, which is more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the unpainted face is a rectangle. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of the slicing plane cutting through the cylinder, creating a flat face on each half. The area of this face is the area of the portion of the plane inside the cylinder.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area can be found by calculating the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors in the plane.\n\nWait, earlier, I found the normal vector to the plane is (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3). So, the area of the face can be calculated using the projection of the cylinder's surface onto the slicing plane.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to find the area directly.\n\nSince the slicing plane intersects the cylinder along the quadrilateral ABCD, the area of the face is the area of ABCD. But ABCD is a trapezoid.\n\nSo, let's calculate the area of trapezoid ABCD.\n\nA trapezoid has two parallel sides, which in this case are AB and CD.\n\nThe length of AB is 6\u221a3, as calculated before.\n\nThe length of CD is the same as AB because it's a chord subtending 120 degrees on the top face. So, CD is also 6\u221a3.\n\nThe height of the trapezoid is the distance between the two parallel sides AB and CD. Since AB is on the bottom face at z=0 and CD is on the top face at z=8, the distance between them along the z-axis is 8. However, because the sides are slanting, the actual height of the trapezoid (the perpendicular distance between AB and CD) is not 8.\n\nWait, actually, in the slicing plane, the height of the trapezoid would be the distance between lines AB and CD along the direction perpendicular to them in the plane.\n\nBut since AB and CD are both vertical in their respective circular faces, their direction is along the z-axis. So, in the slicing plane, the perpendicular distance between AB and CD would be the horizontal distance between them.\n\nWait, AB is at x=-3, and CD is at x=3. So, the horizontal distance between them is 6. But in the slicing plane, which is inclined, the perpendicular distance might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to calculate the distance between lines AB and CD in the slicing plane.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the area using coordinates.\n\nWe have four points: A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0), C(3, 3\u221a3, 8), D(3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nSo, the trapezoid ABCD has vertices at these points. To find its area, we can use the shoelace formula in 3D, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the trapezoid lies on the plane, we can project it onto a 2D plane where calculations are easier.\n\nLet me choose a coordinate system on the slicing plane.\n\nFirst, let's find a basis for the slicing plane.\n\nWe have the normal vector n = (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3). Let's find two orthonormal vectors lying on the plane.\n\nFirst, let's find a vector in the plane. Let's take vector AB: from A to B is (0, -6\u221a3, 0). So, AB = (0, -6\u221a3, 0).\n\nAnother vector in the plane is from A to the center: from A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0) to center (0,0,4): vector AC = (3, -3\u221a3, 4).\n\nSo, we have two vectors in the plane: AB = (0, -6\u221a3, 0) and AC = (3, -3\u221a3, 4).\n\nWe can use these to form a basis for the plane.\n\nNow, to compute the area of the trapezoid, we can use the cross product of vectors AB and AC, but wait, AB and AC are not necessarily sides of the trapezoid.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider the trapezoid as a quadrilateral and use the formula for the area of a trapezoid: (average of the two parallel sides) multiplied by the distance between them.\n\nThe two parallel sides are AB and CD, each of length 6\u221a3. The distance between them is the height of the trapezoid.\n\nBut how do we compute the height?\n\nIn the slicing plane, the distance between lines AB and CD can be found by taking a point on AB and a point on CD and finding the perpendicular distance between them in the plane.\n\nWait, but AB and CD are skew lines in 3D, but since they lie on the same plane, they are parallel lines on that plane.\n\nWait, actually, in the slicing plane, AB and CD are both lines on the plane, so they must either be parallel or intersect. Since they are both chords subtending 120 degrees on their respective circular faces, which are aligned, they are parallel.\n\nTherefore, the distance between AB and CD is constant along their lengths.\n\nSo, to find the distance between AB and CD, we can take a point on AB and a point on CD and find the perpendicular distance in the slicing plane.\n\nLet's take point A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0) on AB and point C(3, 3\u221a3, 8) on CD.\n\nThe vector AC is from A to C: (3 - (-3), 3\u221a3 - 3\u221a3, 8 - 0) = (6, 0, 8).\n\nNow, the distance between AB and CD can be found by projecting AC onto the direction perpendicular to AB.\n\nBut AB is along the direction (0, -6\u221a3, 0), so the direction vector of AB is (0, -1, 0) in the plane.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Since AB and CD are both vertical lines on their respective circular faces, their direction is along the z-axis. But in the slicing plane, their direction is along a different axis.\n\nWait, perhaps the height of the trapezoid is the component of AC perpendicular to AB.\n\nWait, vector AC is (6, 0, 8). The direction of AB is (0, -6\u221a3, 0), so the unit vector in AB's direction is (0, -1, 0).\n\nThe projection of AC onto AB's direction is (6, 0, 8) \u2022 (0, -1, 0) = 0. So, the component of AC perpendicular to AB is the entire vector AC, which is  sqrt(6^2 + 0^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because AC is a diagonal vector.\n\nWait, maybe I should compute the distance between the lines AB and CD.\n\nIn 3D, the distance between two parallel lines can be found by taking the norm of the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting any two points on the lines.\n\nThe direction vector of AB and CD is the same. Let's compute the direction vector of AB: from A to B is (0, -6\u221a3, 0), so direction vector d = (0, -6\u221a3, 0).\n\nTake points A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0) on AB and C(3, 3\u221a3, 8) on CD.\n\nThe vector AC is (6, 0, 8).\n\nThe distance between AB and CD is |(AC) \u00d7 d| / |d|.\n\nCompute AC \u00d7 d:\n\nAC = (6, 0, 8)\nd = (0, -6\u221a3, 0)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i    j        k|\n|6     0        8|\n|0  -6\u221a3       0|\n\n= i*(0*0 - 8*(-6\u221a3)) - j*(6*0 - 8*0) + k*(6*(-6\u221a3) - 0*0)\n\n= i*(0 + 48\u221a3) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(-36\u221a3 - 0)\n\n= (48\u221a3, 0, -36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is sqrt( (48\u221a3)^2 + 0^2 + (-36\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt( (48^2 * 3) + (36^2 * 3) ) = sqrt( 3*(48^2 + 36^2) )\n\nCompute 48^2 = 2304, 36^2 = 1296. So, 2304 + 1296 = 3600. So, sqrt(3*3600) = sqrt(10800) = sqrt(3600*3) = 60\u221a3.\n\nThe magnitude of d is sqrt(0^2 + (-6\u221a3)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(36*3) = sqrt(108) = 6\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the distance between AB and CD is |AC \u00d7 d| / |d| = (60\u221a3) / (6\u221a3) = 10.\n\nSo, the height of the trapezoid is 10.\n\nWait, that's interesting because the height is 10, which is greater than the height of the cylinder, which is 8. That seems odd because the cylinder's height is only 8, so the distance between the two circular faces is 8. How can the distance between AB and CD be 10? That must be a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again.\n\nVector AC is from A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0) to C(3, 3\u221a3, 8): (6, 0, 8).\n\nDirection vector d is (0, -6\u221a3, 0).\n\nCross product AC \u00d7 d:\n\ni*(0*0 - 8*(-6\u221a3)) = i*(48\u221a3)\nj component: -(6*0 - 8*0) = 0\nk*(6*(-6\u221a3) - 0*0) = k*(-36\u221a3)\n\nSo, AC \u00d7 d = (48\u221a3, 0, -36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt( (48\u221a3)^2 + (-36\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt( (48^2 * 3) + (36^2 * 3) ) = sqrt( 3*(48^2 + 36^2) ) = sqrt(3*(2304 + 1296)) = sqrt(3*3600) = sqrt(10800) = 60\u221a3.\n\nThe magnitude of d is sqrt(0 + ( -6\u221a3 )^2 + 0 ) = sqrt(108) = 6\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the distance is 60\u221a3 / 6\u221a3 = 10.\n\nHmm, so the distance between AB and CD is 10 units, which is longer than the height of the cylinder, which is 8. That seems counterintuitive because the cylinder's height is only 8. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the distance.\n\nWait, but in the slicing plane, the lines AB and CD are not aligned along the cylinder's axis, so the distance between them is measured along the direction perpendicular to both lines in the slicing plane, which could indeed be longer than the cylinder's height.\n\nSo, if the height of the trapezoid is 10, and the two parallel sides are each 6\u221a3, then the area is (6\u221a3 + 6\u221a3)/2 * 10 = (12\u221a3)/2 *10 = 6\u221a3 *10 = 60\u221a3.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, the area of the trapezoid ABCD is 60\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, if the area is 60\u221a3, then a=0, b=60, c=3, and a+b+c=63.\n\nBut in my first attempt, I thought the cross-section was a parallelogram with area 60\u221a3, which led to the same conclusion.\n\nHowever, in the second attempt, I considered the intersection as a trapezoid with area 60\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem mentions that the block is sliced in half along the plane, revealing a flat, unpainted face on each half. So, each half has a face which is a portion of the slicing plane. Therefore, the area of each unpainted face is half of the area of the trapezoid ABCD.\n\nWait, no, because when you slice the cylinder along the plane, the plane divides the cylinder into two congruent halves. Each half has a face which is a portion of the slicing plane. Since the slicing plane intersects the cylinder along the trapezoid ABCD, each half will have half of the trapezoid as its face.\n\nTherefore, the area of each unpainted face is half of 60\u221a3, which is 30\u221a3.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion.\n\nWait, no, actually, the area of the trapezoid is 60\u221a3, and since the plane divides the cylinder into two equal halves, each half has a face which is exactly half of the trapezoid. Therefore, the area of each unpainted face is 30\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem states that the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that the area might involve both \u03c0 and a radical term. So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the unpainted face is not the trapezoid but another shape.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is a rectangle. Let me think. When you slice the cylinder along the plane, the intersection with the curved surface is an ellipse, but the flat face is on each half. Each half's flat face is a rectangle.\n\nWait, but how? The slicing plane is inclined, so the intersection with the curved surface is an ellipse, but the flat face is a rectangle?\n\nWait, no, the flat face is the portion of the slicing plane that was inside the cylinder. So, it's the area bounded by the plane and the cylinder.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is a rectangle whose sides are the height of the cylinder and the length of the chord AB.\n\nBut the height of the cylinder is 8, and the length of AB is 6\u221a3, so the area would be 8*6\u221a3 = 48\u221a3, which is not in the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac unless a=0.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so maybe there is a circular component.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the unpainted face is a combination of a rectangle and a sector, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: the slicing plane creates an ellipse on the curved surface, but the flat face is a rectangle. But in reality, the flat face is the intersection of the slicing plane with the cylinder's interior, which is a portion bounded by the two circular faces and the slicing plane.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is a rectangle with one side being the height of the cylinder (8) and the other side being the length of AB (6\u221a3). So, the area would be 8 * 6\u221a3 = 48\u221a3.\n\nBut again, that doesn't involve \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the area is the area of the ellipse. The area of an ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nTo find the area of the ellipse formed by the intersection of the slicing plane with the cylinder, we need to find the major and minor axes.\n\nThe cylinder has radius 6, and the slicing plane is inclined at an angle. The minor axis of the ellipse will be equal to the radius of the cylinder, which is 6. The major axis will be equal to the radius divided by cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the slicing plane and the axis of the cylinder.\n\nWait, let's find the angle between the slicing plane and the axis of the cylinder.\n\nThe normal vector to the slicing plane is (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3). The axis of the cylinder is along the z-axis, with direction vector (0,0,1).\n\nThe angle between the normal vector and the z-axis is given by the dot product:\n\ncos(theta) = (n \u2022 k) / |n| |k| = (3\u221a3) / sqrt( ( -4\u221a3 )^2 + 0^2 + (3\u221a3)^2 ) = (3\u221a3) / sqrt( 48 + 27 ) = (3\u221a3)/sqrt(75) = (3\u221a3)/(5\u221a3) )= 3/5.\n\nSo, theta = arccos(3/5). Therefore, the angle between the slicing plane and the z-axis is theta, and the angle between the slicing plane and the horizontal is 90 - theta.\n\nThe major axis of the ellipse is equal to the diameter divided by sin(theta), because the ellipse is formed by the intersection of the plane with the cylinder.\n\nWait, actually, the major axis length is 2a = 2r / sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the slicing plane and the axis.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for the area of an ellipse formed by slicing a cylinder.\n\nThe area of the ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis. For a cylinder of radius r, the semi-minor axis is r, and the semi-major axis is r / sin(theta), where theta is the angle between the slicing plane and the axis.\n\nSo, area = \u03c0 * (r / sin(theta)) * r = \u03c0 r^2 / sin(theta).\n\nBut in this case, the slicing plane is at an angle theta from the axis, where cos(theta) = 3/5, so sin(theta) = 4/5.\n\nTherefore, the area of the ellipse is \u03c0 * 6^2 / (4/5) = \u03c0 * 36 / (4/5) = \u03c0 * 36 * (5/4) = \u03c0 * 45 = 45\u03c0.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, if the area is 45\u03c0, then a=45, b=0, c=0, but c must not be divisible by the square of any prime, which is satisfied, but b is zero. However, the problem statement might require both terms, but maybe not necessarily.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac\", which suggests that both a and b are non-zero. So, perhaps the area isn't just the ellipse but something else.\n\nWait, maybe the unpainted face is a combination of the ellipse and another shape, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area is not the ellipse but the flat face, which is a rectangle or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, going back, when you slice the cylinder along the plane, the flat face on each half is the intersection of the slicing plane with the cylinder's interior. This is a flat, unpainted face.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is the area of the rectangle formed by the height of the cylinder and the length of the chord AB.\n\nBut chord AB is 6\u221a3, and the height is 8, so the area would be 6\u221a3 * 8 = 48\u221a3.\n\nBut again, that doesn't involve \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the flat face is a parallelogram with base equal to AB and height equal to the distance from AB to the plane's intersection with the top face.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the fact that the slicing plane cuts through the cylinder, creating two congruent halves. Each half has a flat face which is a rectangle with sides equal to the height of the cylinder and the length of the chord AB.\n\nBut then the area would be 8 * 6\u221a3 = 48\u221a3, as before.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests both terms are present. So, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is not a flat rectangle but a portion of the cylinder's surface. But no, the problem says it's a flat, unpainted face.\n\nWait, another idea: the flat, unpainted face is actually a portion of the slicing plane that is bounded by the cylinder's surface. So, it's a region on the slicing plane that is inside the cylinder.\n\nTo compute the area of this region, perhaps we can use the formula for the area of a plane cutting through a cylinder, which is an ellipse, but since it's a flat face, it's a different shape.\n\nWait, actually, the flat face is a rectangle if the slicing plane is perpendicular to the axis, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps the area can be found by calculating the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors in the slicing plane.\n\nEarlier, I found the normal vector to the slicing plane is (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3). The area of the parallelogram can be found by the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors in the plane.\n\nBut wait, the area of the face is the area of the region on the slicing plane inside the cylinder.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area by integrating over the region, but that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the area of the face is equal to the area of the base times the cosine of the angle between the slicing plane and the base.\n\nWait, the base is the circular face with area \u03c0*6^2=36\u03c0. The angle between the slicing plane and the base is theta, where theta is the angle between the normal vectors of the two planes.\n\nThe base is the circular face on the bottom, with normal vector (0,0,1). The slicing plane has normal vector (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3). The angle between the normals is given by the dot product:\n\ncos(theta) = (0*(-4\u221a3) + 0*0 + 1*3\u221a3) / (|n1| |n2|) = (3\u221a3) / (sqrt(0 + 0 + 1^2) * sqrt( ( -4\u221a3 )^2 + 0 + (3\u221a3)^2 )) = (3\u221a3) / (1 * sqrt(48 + 27)) = (3\u221a3)/sqrt(75) = (3\u221a3)/(5\u221a3) )= 3/5.\n\nSo, theta = arccos(3/5). Therefore, the angle between the slicing plane and the base is theta, so the area of the face is the area of the base divided by cos(theta): 36\u03c0 / (3/5) = 36\u03c0 * (5/3) = 60\u03c0.\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier conclusion. Also, the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which would require 60\u03c0, but in this case, it's just 60\u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area is the area of the base times sin(theta): 36\u03c0 * (4/5) = 28.8\u03c0, which is not an integer coefficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think of the area as the area of the projection of the base onto the slicing plane.\n\nWait, the area of the face is equal to the area of the base divided by cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the normals. So, 36\u03c0 / (3/5) = 60\u03c0, which is a\u03c0 with a=60.\n\nBut the problem states the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which would require both terms. So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the face is not the entire base but a portion of it. Since the slicing plane passes through A, B, and the center, the intersection with the base is chord AB, which is 6\u221a3 in length.\n\nSo, perhaps the area is the area of the sector defined by chord AB minus the area of the triangle, but that would be a circular segment, which is a part of the circular face, not the flat face.\n\nWait, no, the flat face is on the slicing plane, not on the circular face.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the slicing plane as a flat surface. The area of the unpainted face is the area of the portion of the slicing plane inside the cylinder.\n\nTo compute this, I can parametrize the intersection of the slicing plane with the cylinder.\n\nThe cylinder is defined by x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36, and the slicing plane is 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nSo, in the slicing plane, we can express z in terms of x: z = (4x + 12)/3.\n\nSubstituting into the cylinder equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nBut we need to express y in terms of x or something else. Alternatively, we can parametrize the intersection curve.\n\nWait, the intersection of the plane and the cylinder is an ellipse. The parametric equations can be found by expressing variables in terms of an angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can perform a coordinate transformation to make the plane align with one of the coordinate planes.\n\nLet me rotate the coordinate system so that the slicing plane becomes the xy-plane. Then, the intersection curve would be a circle, and the area would be easier to compute.\n\nBut this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the area using the formula for the area of an ellipse.\n\nThe area of the ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nTo find a and b, we can use the angle theta between the slicing plane and the axis.\n\nEarlier, we found that sin(theta) = 4/5, so the semi-major axis is 6 / sin(theta) = 6 / (4/5) = 6*(5/4) = 30/4 = 15/2.\n\nThe semi-minor axis is 6.\n\nTherefore, the area is \u03c0*(15/2)*6 = \u03c0*(90/2) = 45\u03c0.\n\nBut again, this is just 45\u03c0, which doesn't involve the radical term.\n\nBut the problem states the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, perhaps the area isn't the ellipse but another shape.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is not the ellipse but the flat face, which is a rectangle or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, going back, when we slice the cylinder along the plane, each half has a flat face which is a parallelogram.\n\nLet me think of the cylinder as being split into two parts by the slicing plane. Each part is a half-cylinder, but the flat face is a parallelogram.\n\nThe area of this parallelogram can be calculated by the base times the height. The base is the length of AB, which is 6\u221a3, and the height is the distance from AB to the plane's intersection with the top face, which we found earlier as 10. So, the area is 6\u221a3 * 10 = 60\u221a3.\n\nBut wait, that would make the area 60\u221a3, which is consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nBut then the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, if it's 60\u221a3, then a=0, b=60, c=3, and a+b+c=63.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which implies both terms might be present. So, perhaps my approach is missing something.\n\nWait, another thought: the flat, unpainted face is not just the parallelogram but also includes a portion of the original curved surface. But no, the problem says it's a flat face, so it's entirely a flat surface.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the flat face is a rectangle with sides equal to the length of AB and the height of the cylinder. But AB is 6\u221a3 and the height is 8, so the area would be 6\u221a3 *8 = 48\u221a3.\n\nBut again, this doesn't involve \u03c0.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors in the slicing plane.\n\nEarlier, we found vectors AB = (0, -6\u221a3, 0) and AC = (3, -3\u221a3, 4).\n\nThe area of the parallelogram formed by these vectors is the magnitude of their cross product.\n\nCompute AB \u00d7 AC:\n\nAB = (0, -6\u221a3, 0)\nAC = (3, -3\u221a3, 4)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i        j          k|\n|0     -6\u221a3        0|\n|3    -3\u221a3        4|\n\n= i*(-6\u221a3*4 - 0*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(0*4 - 0*3) + k*(0*(-3\u221a3) - (-6\u221a3)*3)\n\n= i*(-24\u221a3 - 0) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(0 - (-18\u221a3))\n\n= (-24\u221a3, 0, 18\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt( (-24\u221a3)^2 + 0^2 + (18\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt( (576*3) + (324*3) ) = sqrt( 1728 + 972 ) = sqrt(2700) = sqrt(900*3) = 30\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is 30\u221a3.\n\nBut wait, the parallelogram is formed by vectors AB and AC, which are sides of the trapezoid ABCD. So, the area of the trapezoid is 60\u221a3, as calculated before, and the area of the parallelogram is 30\u221a3, which is half of that.\n\nBut the problem says each half has an unpainted face. So, each half has a face which is a parallelogram with area 30\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem states the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, if it's 30\u221a3, then a=0, b=30, c=3, and a+b+c=33.\n\nBut in my previous attempts, I found the area to be 60\u221a3, which would correspond to a=0, b=60, c=3, giving 63. But now, considering the area of the parallelogram as 30\u221a3, which is half of that.\n\nWait, perhaps the area of the face is 30\u221a3, which would make a=0, b=30, c=3, and a+b+c=33.\n\nBut I'm confused because in the first approach, I considered the entire trapezoid ABCD as the intersection, which had area 60\u221a3, but each half only has half of that.\n\nWait, perhaps the area of the unpainted face is indeed 30\u221a3.\n\nBut let's check with the Asymptote code provided. The Asymptote code draws the cylinder and the slicing plane. From the code, it seems that the slicing plane creates a face that is a parallelogram.\n\nIn the Asymptote code, the picture is divided into left and right halves. On the right half, the face is drawn as a parallelogram with vertices at (3,3\u221a3,8), (3,-3\u221a3,8), (-3,-3\u221a3,0), and (-3,3\u221a3,0). So, this is the same as the trapezoid ABCD.\n\nBut in the right half, the face is a parallelogram, which connects (3,3\u221a3,8) to (3,-3\u221a3,8) to (-3,-3\u221a3,0) to (-3,3\u221a3,0) and back. So, this is actually a parallelogram.\n\nWait, so the right half's face is a parallelogram with vertices at C, D, A, B.\n\nSo, the area of this parallelogram is the magnitude of the cross product of vectors CD and CA.\n\nWait, vector CD is from C to D: (0, -6\u221a3, 0)\nVector CA is from C to A: (-6, 6\u221a3, -8)\n\nCompute the cross product CD \u00d7 CA:\n\nCD = (0, -6\u221a3, 0)\nCA = (-6, 6\u221a3, -8)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i        j          k|\n|0     -6\u221a3        0|\n|-6    6\u221a3       -8|\n\n= i*(-6\u221a3*(-8) - 0*6\u221a3) - j*(0*(-8) - 0*(-6)) + k*(0*6\u221a3 - (-6\u221a3)*(-6))\n\n= i*(48\u221a3 - 0) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(0 - 36\u221a3)\n\n= (48\u221a3, 0, -36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude is sqrt( (48\u221a3)^2 + 0 + (-36\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt( 48^2 *3 + 36^2 *3 ) = sqrt( 3*(2304 + 1296) ) = sqrt(3*3600) = sqrt(10800) = 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is 60\u221a3.\n\nBut in the Asymptote code, the right half's face is a parallelogram with area 60\u221a3, so each half has a face with area 60\u221a3.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces\", so it's 60\u221a3, which is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3, so a+b+c=63.\n\nBut in the second attempt, I considered the area as 30\u221a3, but that was a mistake because the parallelogram actually spans the entire face, not half.\n\nTherefore, the correct area is 60\u221a3, leading to a+b+c=63.\n\nSo, despite the initial confusion, the correct answer is 63.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves slicing a right circular cylinder with a plane passing through two points on the circular face and the center of the cylinder. The goal is to find the area of the newly exposed face, which is a parallelogram. \n\n1. **Identify Points and Plane**:\n   - Points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are on the circumference of the base, separated by a 120\u00b0 arc.\n   - The plane passes through \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and the center of the cylinder.\n\n2. **Calculate Chord Length**:\n   - The chord \\( AB \\) has a length of \\( 6\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\n3. **Determine Plane Equation**:\n   - Using points \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and the center, the plane's equation is found to be \\( 4x - 3z = -12 \\).\n\n4. **Find Intersection Points**:\n   - The plane intersects the top face of the cylinder at points \\( C \\) and \\( D \\).\n\n5. **Calculate Area of Parallelogram**:\n   - The area is computed using the cross product of vectors in the slicing plane, resulting in an area of \\( 60\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\n6. **Express Area in Given Form**:\n   - The area \\( 60\\sqrt{3} \\) fits the form \\( a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c} \\) with \\( a = 0 \\), \\( b = 60 \\), and \\( c = 3 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\( a + b + c = 63 \\).\n\n\\boxed{63}",

          "reasoning": "Alright, let me try to figure out this AIME problem step by step. So, we have a right circular cylinder with radius 6 and height 8. The entire surface is painted blue. Points A and B are on the edge of one of the circular faces, and the arc AB measures 120 degrees. Then, the block is sliced in half along a plane passing through A, B, and the center of the cylinder, revealing an unpainted face on each half. We need to find the area of one of these unpainted faces, which is given in the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, and then find a + b + c.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the cylinder. It's a right circular cylinder, so the bases are circles with radius 6, and the height is 8. The points A and B are on the circumference of one of these circular faces, and the arc between them is 120 degrees. Since the circumference of a circle is 360 degrees, a 120-degree arc is one-third of the circle.\n\nI remember that the length of an arc is given by (\u03b8/360) * 2\u03c0r, where \u03b8 is the central angle in degrees. So, the length of arc AB would be (120/360) * 2\u03c0*6 = (1/3) * 12\u03c0 = 4\u03c0. But actually, I think we might need the chord length AB instead of the arc length because when we slice the cylinder, the plane passes through points A, B, and the center.\n\nThe chord length AB can be found using the formula for chord length: 2r sin(\u03b8/2), where \u03b8 is the central angle. So, \u03b8 is 120 degrees, so \u03b8/2 is 60 degrees. Thus, chord AB is 2*6*sin(60\u00b0) = 12*(\u221a3/2) = 6\u221a3. So, AB is 6\u221a3 units long.\n\nNow, the plane slices through points A, B, and the center of the cylinder. The center of the cylinder is the center of the circular base, let's call it point O. So, the plane passes through points A, B, and O.\n\nI think the shape of the unpainted face is a flat surface created by this plane cutting through the cylinder. Since the cylinder is symmetric, and the plane passes through the center, the unpainted face on each half will be congruent.\n\nTo find the area of this unpainted face, I need to figure out what shape it is. It can't be a rectangle because the plane is slicing through the cylinder at an angle, not parallel to the base or the side. Similarly, it's not a circle or an ellipse because those would require different slicing planes.\n\nWait, actually, when you slice a cylinder with a plane, the cross-section can be an ellipse, but in this case, since the plane passes through the center and two points on the circumference, maybe it's a different shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a parallelogram. Let me think.\n\nIf I imagine the cylinder and the slicing plane, it should intersect the cylinder along an ellipse, but since the plane passes through the center, the cross-section on each half would actually be a flat face. Hmm, maybe it's a rectangle or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, but when slicing through a cylinder along a plane that passes through the center and two points on the base, the cross-section is actually a rectangle if the plane is vertical, but in this case, the plane is inclined because points A and B are on the edge of the circular face, not on a vertical line.\n\nSo, perhaps the cross-section is a parallelogram. To find the area of this parallelogram, I need to find the vectors defining it.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system to model this. Let's place the cylinder such that its axis is along the z-axis. The center of the base is at (0, 0, 0), and the height goes up to (0, 0, 8). The circular base on the bottom is in the z=0 plane, and the top base is in the z=8 plane.\n\nPoints A and B are on the circumference of the base at z=0. Let me find their coordinates. Since arc AB is 120 degrees, and assuming point A is at (6, 0, 0), then point B would be 120 degrees around the circle. In terms of coordinates, that would be (6 cos 120\u00b0, 6 sin 120\u00b0, 0).\n\nCalculating that, cos 120\u00b0 is -1/2, and sin 120\u00b0 is \u221a3/2. So, point B is at (6*(-1/2), 6*(\u221a3/2), 0) = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nWait, actually, if point A is at (6, 0, 0), then moving 120 degrees counterclockwise would place point B at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). Alternatively, if we go clockwise, it might be (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). But since the problem doesn't specify, I think it's safe to assume one or the other, as it shouldn't affect the area.\n\nBut in the Asymptote code provided, it seems that point A is labeled on the left half of the circle, and point B is on the lower part. So, perhaps point A is (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) and point B is (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). Wait, no, actually, in the Asymptote code, point A is at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) and point B is at (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). So, they are both on the same vertical line x = -3, but on opposite sides in y.\n\nWait, no, hold on. If the arc AB is 120 degrees, and the points are on the circumference, then if point A is at (6, 0, 0), point B would be at (6 cos 120\u00b0, 6 sin 120\u00b0, 0) = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). Alternatively, if the arc is 120 degrees the other way, it might be (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). But in the Asymptote code, points A and B are on the same vertical line x = -3, which suggests that the chord AB is vertical.\n\nWait, so if points A and B are both at x = -3, but different y and z? Wait, no, the points A and B are on the circular face at z=0, so their z-coordinate is 0.\n\nWait, maybe I need to reorient the cylinder. Alternatively, perhaps the center is at (0, 0, 4), but no, the height is 8, so the center is at (0, 0, 4). Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my coordinate system.\n\nWait, actually, the cylinder has radius 6, height 8, so the bases are at z=0 and z=8, with the center at (0, 0, 4). Points A and B are on the base at z=0. So, their coordinates are on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 in the z=0 plane.\n\nGiven that arc AB is 120 degrees, so central angle 120 degrees. So, if point A is at (6, 0, 0), point B is at (6 cos 120\u00b0, 6 sin 120\u00b0, 0) = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). Alternatively, if the arc is the other way, it would be (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). So, depending on the direction of the arc, point B is either (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) or (-3, -3\u221a3, 0).\n\nBut in the Asymptote code, point A is labeled at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and point B is at (-3, -3\u221a3, 0). So, actually, points A and B are on the same vertical line x = -3, y = \u00b13\u221a3, z=0.\n\nTherefore, the chord AB is vertical, from (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) to (-3, -3\u221a3, 0), which is a vertical line segment of length 6\u221a3, as we found earlier.\n\nNow, the plane passes through points A, B, and the center of the cylinder. The center of the cylinder is at (0, 0, 4). So, the plane passes through three points: A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0), and O(0, 0, 4).\n\nSo, to find the equation of the plane, we can use these three points.\n\nFirst, let's find two vectors in the plane. Vector OA is from O to A: (-3, 3\u221a3, -4). Vector OB is from O to B: (-3, -3\u221a3, -4).\n\nThen, the normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of vectors OA and OB.\n\nLet me compute the cross product:\n\nOA = (-3, 3\u221a3, -4)\nOB = (-3, -3\u221a3, -4)\n\nCross product OA \u00d7 OB is determinant:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 k|\n|-3 3\u221a3 -4|\n|-3 -3\u221a3 -4|\n\nCalculating determinant:\n\ni * (3\u221a3*(-4) - (-4)*(-3\u221a3)) - j * (-3*(-4) - (-4)*(-3)) + k * (-3*(-3\u221a3) - 3\u221a3*(-3))\n\nSimplify each component:\n\ni: 3\u221a3*(-4) - (-4)*(-3\u221a3) = (-12\u221a3) - (12\u221a3) = -24\u221a3\nj: - [ (-3)*(-4) - (-4)*(-3) ] = - [12 - 12] = - [0] = 0\nk: (-3)*(-3\u221a3) - 3\u221a3*(-3) = 9\u221a3 + 9\u221a3 = 18\u221a3\n\nSo, OA \u00d7 OB = (-24\u221a3, 0, 18\u221a3)\n\nWe can simplify this normal vector by dividing by 6: (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3)\n\nSo, the normal vector is (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3). To make it a unit normal, but actually, we don't need to because we just need the plane equation.\n\nThe plane equation can be written as:\n\n-4\u221a3(x - x0) + 0*(y - y0) + 3\u221a3(z - z0) = 0\n\nWe can use point O(0, 0, 4) as (x0, y0, z0):\n\n-4\u221a3(x - 0) + 0*(y - 0) + 3\u221a3(z - 4) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-4\u221a3 x + 3\u221a3 z - 12\u221a3 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a3:\n\n-4x + 3z - 12 = 0\n\nSo, the plane equation is -4x + 3z = 12, or rearranged as 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the cross product calculation again.\n\nWait, OA is (-3, 3\u221a3, -4), and OB is (-3, -3\u221a3, -4). So, cross product is:\n\ni: (3\u221a3*(-4) - (-4)*(-3\u221a3)) = (-12\u221a3) - (12\u221a3) = -24\u221a3\nj: - [ (-3*(-4) - (-4)*(-3)) ] = - [12 - 12] = 0\nk: (-3*(-3\u221a3) - 3\u221a3*(-3)) = 9\u221a3 + 9\u221a3 = 18\u221a3\n\nYes, that's correct. So, normal vector is (-24\u221a3, 0, 18\u221a3). So, plane equation:\n\n-24\u221a3 (x - 0) + 0*(y - 0) + 18\u221a3 (z - 4) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-24\u221a3 x + 18\u221a3 z - 72\u221a3 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 6\u221a3:\n\n-4x + 3z - 12 = 0\n\nWhich is the same as 4x - 3z = -12. So, yes, plane equation is 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nNow, to find the area of the unpainted face, which is the cross-section of the cylinder by this plane.\n\nWait, when we slice the cylinder with this plane, the cross-section is an ellipse. But since we're only slicing half the cylinder, the unpainted face on each half is a portion of that ellipse. Wait, no, actually, the plane cuts through the entire cylinder, but since the cylinder is split into two halves, each half will have a flat face which is the cross-section.\n\nBut wait, the cross-section of a cylinder by a plane is generally an ellipse, unless the plane is parallel to the side or the base, which would give a rectangle or a circle.\n\nBut in this case, the plane is passing through the center and two points on the circumference, so it's not parallel to the side or the base, so the cross-section is an ellipse.\n\nHowever, since we are slicing the cylinder into two halves, each half will have a flat face which is half of the ellipse? Or is it a different shape?\n\nWait, no. When you slice the entire cylinder with a plane, the intersection is an ellipse. But since we're only considering half of the cylinder after slicing, the unpainted face is one of the halves of the ellipse? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is actually a planar surface, which is the intersection of the slicing plane with the cylinder. Since the cylinder is a three-dimensional object, the intersection with a plane is a curve, but in this case, because we're slicing through the entire cylinder, the resulting face is actually a flat ellipse.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac\". If the cross-section is an ellipse, its area would be \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. But in the form given, it's a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that the area has both a \u03c0 term and a radical term. So, maybe the cross-section is not a pure ellipse but a combination of circular and linear elements?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle or a parallelogram with some curved edges? Hmm, no, that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. The unpainted face is a flat face on each half, so it's a planar region. Since the slicing plane cuts through the cylinder, the intersection is an ellipse, but when considering half the cylinder, the face is just a portion of that ellipse? No, I think the entire face is an ellipse.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac\". If it's an ellipse, the area would be \u03c0ab, which is a multiple of \u03c0, but there's also a radical term, so maybe it's a combination.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is not the entire ellipse, but a region that includes both straight and curved edges? For example, if the slicing plane cuts through the cylinder and also through the top and bottom faces, then the unpainted face might be a combination of a rectangle and a circular segment.\n\nBut in this problem, the entire surface of the cylinder is painted, so when we slice it, the new face is entirely unpainted. Therefore, the shape of the unpainted face is just the intersection of the slicing plane with the cylinder, which is an ellipse.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac\". If it's an ellipse, the area would be \u03c0 times the product of the semi-major and semi-minor axes. So, maybe we need to find the semi-major and semi-minor axes of this ellipse.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle or a parallelogram, but given the slicing plane is inclined, it's a parallelogram. Wait, but earlier when I thought of it as a parallelogram, I got an area of 60\u221a3, which is just a multiple of \u221a3, but the problem mentions both \u03c0 and \u221ac terms.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the cross-section as a parallelogram. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is a rectangle because the plane is slicing through the cylinder vertically, but since the plane is not perpendicular to the base, it's not a rectangle but a parallelogram. However, in this case, since the plane passes through the center and two points on the circumference, it's actually cutting through the cylinder in such a way that the cross-section is a rectangle.\n\nWait, no, because the plane is inclined, so it should be a parallelogram. But maybe it's a rectangle if the sides are perpendicular. Wait, let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle because the plane passes through the center and is perpendicular to the axis? Wait, no, the plane passes through the center but is not necessarily perpendicular.\n\nWait, let me get back to basics.\n\nThe cylinder can be parameterized. The equation of the cylinder is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 6\u00b2, extending from z=0 to z=8.\n\nThe slicing plane has equation 4x - 3z = -12, or rearranged as 4x + 12 = 3z, so z = (4x + 12)/3 = (4/3)x + 4.\n\nSo, in the cylinder, any point (x, y, z) must satisfy both x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36 and z = (4/3)x + 4.\n\nTo find the intersection curve, we can parameterize the cylinder and substitute into the plane equation.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the cross-section by expressing y in terms of x or vice versa.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to find the shape of the cross-section.\n\nWait, since the cylinder is circular, and the plane is cutting through it, the intersection should be an ellipse. So, the area of the ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nBut the problem states the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which is not the standard form of an ellipse's area. So, perhaps the cross-section is not a pure ellipse but a combination of a rectangle and an ellipse? Or maybe the cross-section is a different shape.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section of a cylinder by a plane is always a conic section, which can be an ellipse, circle, parabola, or hyperbola. In this case, since the plane is not parallel to the side or the base, it's an ellipse.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that the area has both a \u03c0 term and a radical term, which doesn't align with the standard area of an ellipse. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the shape of the unpainted face.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is not the entire cross-section but only a part of it, which includes both straight and curved edges. For example, if the plane slices through the cylinder and also through the top and bottom circular faces, then the unpainted face would be a region bounded by the slicing plane and the circular edges.\n\nBut in the problem, it says the block is sliced in half along the plane, revealing a flat, unpainted face on each half. So, the unpainted face is entirely flat, meaning it's the cross-section of the slicing plane through the cylinder.\n\nTherefore, it must be an ellipse. So, the area should be \u03c0 times the product of the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nBut the problem states the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which is confusing because an ellipse's area is only a multiple of \u03c0. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and the cross-section is not an ellipse but another shape.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is a rectangle or a parallelogram. Let me try that approach.\n\nIf I consider the slicing plane passing through points A, B, and the center O, then the cross-section on each half is a parallelogram. Because when you slice a cylinder with a plane, the intersection is an ellipse, but since we are only taking half the cylinder, the face is a parallelogram.\n\nWait, but the cylinder is a smooth surface; slicing it with a plane should result in a smooth cross-section, not a polygon. So, the cross-section should be an ellipse, not a parallelogram.\n\nBut then why does the problem refer to the unpainted face as flat? Because the slicing plane is flat, so the intersection is a flat face, but the shape of the intersection is an ellipse.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is referring to the face on each half, which is half of the ellipse. But no, an ellipse is a smooth curve, so half of it wouldn't be a flat face.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to compute the area of the cross-section.\n\nSince the plane is given by 4x - 3z = -12, and the cylinder is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36, we can find the intersection.\n\nLet me parameterize the cylinder. Let\u2019s use cylindrical coordinates where x = r cos \u03b8, y = r sin \u03b8, z = z. Since it's a cylinder of radius 6, r = 6.\n\nSo, x = 6 cos \u03b8, y = 6 sin \u03b8, z = z.\n\nSubstitute into the plane equation: 4*(6 cos \u03b8) - 3z = -12 => 24 cos \u03b8 - 3z = -12 => 24 cos \u03b8 + 12 = 3z => z = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4.\n\nSo, on the cylinder, the intersection curve is given by x = 6 cos \u03b8, y = 6 sin \u03b8, z = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4.\n\nThis is a parametric equation of the ellipse. To find the area, we can compute the integral over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 of the magnitude of the cross product of the derivatives of the parametric equations.\n\nBut that seems complicated. Alternatively, we can recognize that the intersection of a plane and a cylinder is an ellipse, and the area can be found using the formula for the area of an ellipse, which is \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nTo find a and b, we can compute the lengths of the semi-axes of the ellipse.\n\nAlternatively, we can find the angle between the slicing plane and the axis of the cylinder. The area of the ellipse is equal to the area of the base circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall. The area of the cross-section (ellipse) is equal to the area of the base circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis. So, if \u03b8 is the angle between the slicing plane and the axis, then Area = \u03c0r\u00b2 / cos \u03b8.\n\nBut I need to find \u03b8. How can I find the angle between the slicing plane and the cylinder's axis?\n\nThe cylinder's axis is along the z-axis. The slicing plane has a normal vector n = (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3). The angle between the plane and the z-axis is the angle between the normal vector and the z-axis.\n\nWait, no, the angle between the plane and the z-axis is complementary to the angle between the normal vector and the z-axis.\n\nThe angle \u03c6 between the normal vector and the z-axis can be found using the dot product:\n\ncos \u03c6 = (n \u00b7 k) / |n|, where k is the unit vector in the z-direction.\n\nn \u00b7 k = 3\u221a3\n\n|n| = sqrt( (-4\u221a3)^2 + 0^2 + (3\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt( 16*3 + 0 + 9*3 ) = sqrt(48 + 27) = sqrt(75) = 5\u221a3\n\nSo, cos \u03c6 = (3\u221a3) / (5\u221a3) = 3/5\n\nTherefore, \u03c6 = arccos(3/5). So, the angle between the normal vector and the z-axis is arccos(3/5). Therefore, the angle between the slicing plane and the z-axis is 90\u00b0 - \u03c6 = arcsin(3/5).\n\nTherefore, the angle \u03b8 between the slicing plane and the cylinder's axis is arcsin(3/5). Therefore, the area of the ellipse is \u03c0r\u00b2 / sin \u03b8.\n\nWait, no, actually, the area of the ellipse is \u03c0r\u00b2 / cos \u03b1, where \u03b1 is the angle between the plane and the axis. Wait, I might be mixing up the formulas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the semi-axes of the ellipse.\n\nGiven the parametric equations:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4\n\nWe can express z in terms of x: z = (4/3)x + 4, as we had earlier.\n\nSo, in the plane, the equation is 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nTo find the ellipse, we can write z in terms of x and substitute into the cylinder equation, but perhaps it's better to use another approach.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the area using the formula for the area of an ellipse given by the intersection of a plane and a cylinder.\n\nThe general formula for the area of the intersection of a plane and a right circular cylinder is \u03c0r\u00b2 / sin \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, no, actually, the area is \u03c0r\u00b2 / sin \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle between the plane and the axis. Wait, I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, I found a resource that says the area of the ellipse formed by slicing a cylinder with radius r by a plane at an angle \u03b8 to the axis is \u03c0r\u00b2 / sin \u03b8.\n\nBut I need to confirm.\n\nWait, no, actually, the area of the ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis.\n\nIn our case, the cylinder has radius 6, and the plane is slicing at an angle \u03b8 to the axis.\n\nThe semi-minor axis of the ellipse is equal to the radius of the cylinder, which is 6.\n\nThe semi-major axis can be found by considering the height of the cylinder along the direction of the plane.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me consider the parametric equations:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = (4/3)x + 4 = (4/3)(6 cos \u03b8) + 4 = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4\n\nSo, in the slicing plane, the coordinates (x, y, z) can be parameterized as (6 cos \u03b8, 6 sin \u03b8, 8 cos \u03b8 + 4).\n\nTo find the area, we can compute the integral over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 of the magnitude of the cross product of the derivatives of the parametric equations.\n\nLet me denote the parametric equations as r(\u03b8) = (6 cos \u03b8, 6 sin \u03b8, 8 cos \u03b8 + 4).\n\nCompute dr/d\u03b8:\n\ndr/d\u03b8 = (-6 sin \u03b8, 6 cos \u03b8, -8 sin \u03b8)\n\nThe magnitude of dr/d\u03b8 is sqrt[ (-6 sin \u03b8)^2 + (6 cos \u03b8)^2 + (-8 sin \u03b8)^2 ]\n\n= sqrt[ 36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 36 cos\u00b2\u03b8 + 64 sin\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\n= sqrt[ (36 + 64) sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 36 cos\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\n= sqrt[ 100 sin\u00b2\u03b8 + 36 cos\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\nHmm, integrating this over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 would give the arc length, not the area. Wait, no, actually, to find the area of the parametric surface, we need to compute the integral over \u03b8 of the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives. But since it's a planar curve, the area is just the area of the ellipse.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area using a different method.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the parametric equations, we can find the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nLooking at the parametric equations:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = 8 cos \u03b8 + 4\n\nIf we project this onto the plane, we can express the coordinates in the plane's coordinate system.\n\nBut this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the intersection curve is an ellipse. The semi-minor axis is the radius of the cylinder, which is 6, because the shortest distance from the axis to the plane is 6. The semi-major axis can be found by considering the length along the direction where the plane is \"tilted\".\n\nWait, actually, the semi-major axis is equal to the radius divided by sin \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, earlier we found that the angle between the plane and the axis is arcsin(3/5). So, \u03b8 = arcsin(3/5).\n\nTherefore, the semi-major axis a = r / sin \u03b8 = 6 / (3/5) = 6 * (5/3) = 10.\n\nAnd the semi-minor axis b = r = 6.\n\nTherefore, the area of the ellipse is \u03c0ab = \u03c0*10*6 = 60\u03c0.\n\nBut the problem states that the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, not just 60\u03c0. So, this suggests that my assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape, which includes both circular and linear components. Maybe it's a combination of a rectangle and a circular segment.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section of a plane cutting through a cylinder is always a conic section, which is an ellipse, circle, parabola, or hyperbola. In this case, it's an ellipse.\n\nBut the problem states that the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which is confusing because the area of an ellipse is \u03c0ab, a multiple of \u03c0. So, unless the problem is referring to a different face.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is not the entire cross-section but only a part of it, which includes both the curved part of the ellipse and a straight edge from the slicing plane through the top and bottom faces.\n\nWait, but the problem says the block is sliced in half along the plane, revealing a flat, unpainted face on each half. So, the unpainted face is entirely flat, meaning it's the cross-section of the slicing plane through the cylinder.\n\nTherefore, it must be an ellipse, and the area should be 60\u03c0. But the problem states it's a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that either I'm missing something or the cross-section is not an ellipse.\n\nWait, maybe the slicing plane intersects the top and bottom faces of the cylinder, creating a polygonal face in addition to the elliptical part. But the problem says the entire surface has been painted, so the only unpainted face is the cross-section, which is entirely flat.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle because the slicing plane is vertical? But in this case, the plane is not vertical because it's tilted.\n\nWait, another thought: the slicing plane passes through points A, B, and the center O. So, in the base circle, points A and B are separated by 120 degrees, and the plane passes through the center. So, the cross-section on the cylinder is a rectangle because the plane is cutting through the cylinder vertically?\n\nWait, no, the plane is not vertical because it's passing through points A and B which are on the circumference, and the center O. So, the plane is inclined.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is a rectangle with sides equal to the chord AB and the height of the cylinder. But the chord AB is 6\u221a3, and the height is 8, but that would make the area 48\u221a3, which is not matching the given form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a parallelogram with base AB and height equal to the height of the cylinder. But the base AB is 6\u221a3, and the height would be the distance from the plane to the opposite side, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area using vectors.\n\nEarlier, we found that the normal vector of the plane is (-4\u221a3, 0, 3\u221a3). The area of the cross-section can be found by projecting the base circle onto the slicing plane.\n\nWait, no, that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the area can be found by computing the determinant of the matrix formed by vectors in the plane.\n\nWait, let me consider vectors in the slicing plane. We have points A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0), and O(0, 0, 4).\n\nSo, vectors OA and OB are:\n\nOA = A - O = (-3, 3\u221a3, -4)\n\nOB = B - O = (-3, -3\u221a3, -4)\n\nWe can compute the area of the parallelogram formed by OA and OB, which is the magnitude of OA \u00d7 OB.\n\nEarlier, we found OA \u00d7 OB = (-24\u221a3, 0, 18\u221a3). The magnitude of this vector is sqrt[ (-24\u221a3)^2 + 0^2 + (18\u221a3)^2 ] = sqrt[ (576*3) + (324*3) ] = sqrt[ 1728 + 972 ] = sqrt[2700] = sqrt[900*3] = 30\u221a3.\n\nBut wait, the area of the parallelogram is equal to the magnitude of OA \u00d7 OB, which is 30\u221a3. However, the cross-section of the cylinder by the plane is an ellipse, not a parallelogram. So, perhaps this area is the area of the parallelogram, but how does that relate to the cross-section?\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is a rectangle or a parallelogram, but since the cylinder is curved, the cross-section is actually an ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing two different things. The area of the parallelogram formed by vectors OA and OB is 30\u221a3, but the cross-sectional area of the cylinder is different.\n\nWait, another approach: The cross-sectional area can be found by considering the area of the base circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the slicing plane and the axis.\n\nEarlier, we found that the angle between the normal vector and the z-axis is arccos(3/5), so the angle between the slicing plane and the z-axis is arcsin(3/5). Therefore, the area of the cross-section is \u03c0r\u00b2 / sin \u03b8 = \u03c0*6\u00b2 / (3/5) = \u03c0*36 / (3/5) = \u03c0*36*(5/3) = 60\u03c0.\n\nBut again, the problem states the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which doesn't match 60\u03c0.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is not an ellipse but a rectangle or another shape. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the lateral surface area, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another thought: The slicing plane cuts through the cylinder, creating an elliptical face, but since we are only considering half the cylinder, the unpainted face is half of that ellipse, which would have an area of 30\u03c0. But the problem states the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so again, this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with sides equal to the chord AB and the height of the cylinder. So, AB is 6\u221a3, and the height is 8, so area would be 6\u221a3 * 8 = 48\u221a3. But this is just a multiple of \u221a3, not involving \u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the area is a combination of the ellipse and another shape, but that seems complicated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the shape. Let me go back.\n\nThe problem says the block is sliced in half along the plane passing through A, B, and the center, revealing a flat, unpainted face on each half. So, the unpainted face is entirely flat, meaning it's a planar face, which is the intersection of the slicing plane with the cylinder. Since the cylinder is a smooth surface, the intersection should be an ellipse.\n\nBut the area is given as a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that the area has both a circular component and a radical component. This is confusing because an ellipse's area is only a multiple of \u03c0.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is not the entire cross-section but includes a portion of the original painted surface. But no, the problem says it's entirely unpainted.\n\nWait, perhaps the slicing plane also intersects the top and bottom faces of the cylinder, creating a polygonal face in addition to the elliptical face. But the problem says the entire surface has been painted, so the only unpainted face is the cross-section.\n\nWait, maybe the slicing plane is not just cutting through the side but also through the top and bottom, creating a composite face. But the problem says it's sliced along the plane passing through A, B, and the center, so it's only cutting through the side and the top and bottom edges.\n\nWait, no, the slicing plane passes through points A and B on the base and the center, so it will intersect the top face as well. So, the intersection with the top face is another chord, symmetric to AB.\n\nTherefore, the unpainted face is a flat face bounded by the slicing plane and the top and bottom edges. So, it's a planar surface connecting points A, B, and their counterparts on the top face.\n\nWait, but the top face is at z=8. So, the slicing plane intersects the top face at points A' and B', which are the projections of A and B along the slicing plane.\n\nWait, let me find the coordinates of A' and B' on the top face.\n\nGiven the slicing plane equation 4x - 3z = -12.\n\nAt the top face, z=8.\n\nSo, substituting z=8 into the plane equation: 4x - 24 = -12 => 4x = 12 => x=3.\n\nSo, the slicing plane intersects the top face (z=8) along the line x=3.\n\nTherefore, points A' and B' are on the top face at x=3, and they must lie on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nSo, substituting x=3, we get 9 + y\u00b2 = 36 => y\u00b2=27 => y= \u00b13\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, points A' are (3, 3\u221a3, 8) and B' are (3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nTherefore, the slicing plane intersects the cylinder along the ellipse from A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0) to A'(3, 3\u221a3, 8) and similarly for B.\n\nTherefore, the unpainted face on each half is a flat face bounded by the slicing plane, which is a quadrilateral with vertices at A, B, B', A'.\n\nWait, but A and B are on the base, and A' and B' are on the top. So, the face is a quadrilateral connecting A to B to B' to A' and back to A.\n\nBut in the Asymptote code, it seems that the slicing plane creates a flat face that is a parallelogram. Wait, but in reality, it's a trapezoid because A and B are on the base, and A' and B' are on the top, but the sides AA' and BB' are not necessarily parallel.\n\nWait, let me check the coordinates:\n\nA: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nB: (-3, -3\u221a3, 0)\n\nA': (3, 3\u221a3, 8)\n\nB': (3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nSo, the quadrilateral is A(-3, 3\u221a3, 0) -> B(-3, -3\u221a3, 0) -> B'(3, -3\u221a3, 8) -> A'(3, 3\u221a3, 8) -> back to A.\n\nThis is a trapezoid because sides AB and A'B' are both horizontal lines (in their respective planes) and are parallel, while sides AA' and BB' are slant edges.\n\nWait, but in 3D space, it's a planar quadrilateral, so it's a trapezoid if AB and A'B' are parallel. Let's check.\n\nVector AB is from A to B: (0, -6\u221a3, 0)\n\nVector A'B' is from A' to B': (0, -6\u221a3, 0)\n\nSo, yes, vectors AB and A'B' are equal, meaning AB and A'B' are parallel and equal in length.\n\nTherefore, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram because both pairs of opposite sides are equal and parallel. Wait, no, only one pair is parallel, so it's a trapezoid.\n\nWait, no, in a trapezoid, only one pair of sides is parallel. Here, AB and A'B' are parallel, while AA' and BB' are not necessarily parallel.\n\nWait, let me compute vectors AA' and BB':\n\nVector AA' is from A to A': (6, 0, 8)\n\nVector BB' is from B to B': (6, 0, 8)\n\nSo, vectors AA' and BB' are equal, meaning sides AA' and BB' are equal and parallel.\n\nTherefore, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram because both pairs of opposite sides are equal and parallel.\n\nSo, the unpainted face is a parallelogram with sides AB and AA'.\n\nWe already found the length of AB is 6\u221a3. The length of AA' is sqrt(6\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + 8\u00b2) = sqrt(36 + 64) = sqrt(100) = 10.\n\nBut in a parallelogram, the area is base * height. However, since it's a parallelogram in 3D space, we can compute its area using the cross product of vectors AB and AA'.\n\nLet me compute vectors AB and AA':\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-3, -3\u221a3, 0) - (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) = (0, -6\u221a3, 0)\n\nVector AA' = A' - A = (3, 3\u221a3, 8) - (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) = (6, 0, 8)\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AA':\n\nAB = (0, -6\u221a3, 0)\n\nAA' = (6, 0, 8)\n\nCross product AB \u00d7 AA' is determinant:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 k|\n|0  -6\u221a3 \u00a0\u00a00|\n|6 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a08|\n\nCalculating determinant:\n\ni * (-6\u221a3*8 - 0*0) - j * (0*8 - 0*6) + k * (0*0 - (-6\u221a3)*6)\n\n= i * (-48\u221a3) - j * (0) + k * (36\u221a3)\n\nSo, AB \u00d7 AA' = (-48\u221a3, 0, 36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt[ (-48\u221a3)^2 + 0^2 + (36\u221a3)^2 ]\n\n= sqrt[ (2304*3) + (1296*3) ]\n\n= sqrt[ 6912 + 3888 ]\n\n= sqrt[ 10800 ]\n\n= sqrt[ 100*108 ]\n\n= 10*sqrt(108)\n\n= 10*sqrt(36*3)\n\n= 10*6*sqrt(3)\n\n= 60\u221a3\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is 60\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem states the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac. Here, we have 60\u221a3, which can be written as 0\u03c0 + 60\u221a3, so a=0, b=60, c=3. Therefore, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac. In my calculation, the area is purely 60\u221a3, which fits the form with a=0. However, the problem might be expecting both terms to be non-zero, but it doesn't specify. So, perhaps 63 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. The parallelogram area is 60\u221a3, which is correct. The Asymptote code also suggests that the cross-section is a parallelogram. Therefore, I think the answer is 63.\n</think>\n\nThe area of the unpainted face is calculated to be \\(60\\sqrt{3}\\), which can be expressed as \\(0\\pi + 60\\sqrt{3}\\). Therefore, \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 60\\), and \\(c = 3\\), leading to \\(a + b + c = 63\\).\n\n\\boxed{63}",

          "reasoning": "Okay, so I have this AIME problem about a cylinder that's been painted blue. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 8. Points A and B are on the edge of one of the circular faces, and the arc between them measures 120 degrees. Then, the block is sliced in half along a plane that passes through points A, B, and the center of the cylinder. This slicing reveals a flat, unpainted face on each half, and I need to find the area of one of these unpainted faces. The area is given in the form \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\), and I need to find \\(a + b + c\\).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the cylinder. It's a right circular cylinder, so the bases are circles with radius 6, and the height is 8. Points A and B are on the edge of one of these circular faces, and the arc between them is 120 degrees. Since the circumference of the circle is \\(2\\pi r = 12\\pi\\), a 120-degree arc would be \\(\\frac{120}{360} \\times 12\\pi = 4\\pi\\). But maybe more importantly, the chord length between A and B can be calculated.\n\nThe chord length formula is \\(2r \\sin(\\theta/2)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the central angle. So, for a 120-degree angle, the chord length is \\(2 \\times 6 \\times \\sin(60^\\circ) = 12 \\times (\\sqrt{3}/2) = 6\\sqrt{3}\\). That seems right.\n\nNow, the plane slices through A, B, and the center of the cylinder. Let me think about what this plane does. Since it passes through the center, it's not just a slice near the surface but goes all the way through the cylinder. The intersection of this plane with the cylinder will create an ellipse on the surface, but since we're slicing through the center, maybe the shape is different.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the slicing reveals a flat, unpainted face on each half. So, the unpainted face is the cross-section of the plane cutting through the cylinder. The area of this cross-section is what I need to find.\n\nI think the cross-section is a parallelogram. Let me try to figure that out. If I slice the cylinder with a plane that goes through two points on the base and the center, the intersection should be a parallelogram because it's cutting through the circular bases and the sides.\n\nBut how do I calculate the area of this parallelogram? I remember that the area of a parallelogram is base times height. The base could be the chord AB, which is \\(6\\sqrt{3}\\). The height would be the distance from the center of the cylinder to the plane, but wait, the plane passes through the center, so the height might be related to the height of the cylinder.\n\nWait, no, the height of the parallelogram isn't the height of the cylinder. Instead, it's the distance between the two parallel sides of the parallelogram. Since the plane passes through the center, maybe the height is the same as the height of the cylinder? No, that doesn't seem right because the plane is slicing at an angle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the vectors involved. If I can find two vectors that define the parallelogram, I can take their cross product to find the area.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let's put the center of the circular face on the xy-plane, with the center at the origin (0,0,0). The height of the cylinder goes along the z-axis, so the top face is at z=8.\n\nPoint A is on the circular face, and the arc from A to B is 120 degrees. Let's place point A at (6, 0, 0). Then, moving 120 degrees around the circle, point B would be at (6 cos 120\u00b0, 6 sin 120\u00b0, 0). Calculating that, cos 120\u00b0 is -1/2, and sin 120\u00b0 is \\(\\sqrt{3}/2\\). So, point B is at (6*(-1/2), 6*(\\sqrt{3}/2), 0) = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nNow, the plane passes through points A, B, and the center of the cylinder (0,0,0). So, these three points define the plane. Let me find the equation of this plane.\n\nTo find the equation of the plane, I can use the three points: A(6,0,0), B(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and O(0,0,0). Let's find two vectors in the plane: vector OA = (6,0,0) and vector OB = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). The normal vector to the plane is the cross product of OA and OB.\n\nCalculating the cross product:\n\nOA \u00d7 OB = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a00\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-3 3\u221a3 \u00a00\n\n= i*(0*0 - 0*3\u221a3) - j*(6*0 - 0*(-3)) + k*(6*3\u221a3 - 0*(-3))\n= i*(0) - j*(0) + k*(18\u221a3)\n= (0, 0, 18\u221a3)\n\nSo the normal vector is (0, 0, 18\u221a3), which simplifies to (0, 0, 1) when normalized. Therefore, the plane equation is z = 0? Wait, that can't be right because points A, B, and O are all on the z=0 plane, but the plane slices through the cylinder, which has height along the z-axis. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, points A and B are on the base at z=0, and the center is also at z=0. So, the plane passing through A, B, and the center is the same as the base, which is z=0. But that doesn't make sense because slicing along z=0 wouldn't reveal any new face\u2014it's already the base. So, I must have messed up something.\n\nWait a second, no. The center of the cylinder is at (0,0,4), right? Because the height is 8, so the center is halfway along the z-axis. So, actually, the center is at (0,0,4), not (0,0,0). That was my mistake. So, let's correct that.\n\nLet me redefine the coordinate system. Let's place the center of the cylinder at (0,0,4). So, the bottom face is at z=0, and the top face is at z=8. Then, point A is on the bottom face at (6,0,0), and point B is on the bottom face at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). The center is at (0,0,4).\n\nSo, now, the plane passes through A(6,0,0), B(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and the center C(0,0,4). Now, let's find the equation of this plane.\n\nFirst, let's find two vectors in the plane. Vector AC is from A to C: (0-6, 0-0, 4-0) = (-6, 0, 4). Vector BC is from B to C: (0 - (-3), 0 - 3\u221a3, 4 - 0) = (3, -3\u221a3, 4).\n\nNow, the normal vector to the plane is the cross product of AC and BC.\n\nCalculating AC \u00d7 BC:\n\nAC = (-6, 0, 4)\nBC = (3, -3\u221a3, 4)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-6 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a04|\n|3 \u00a0-3\u221a3 \u00a04|\n\n= i*(0*4 - 4*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-6*4 - 4*3) + k*(-6*(-3\u221a3) - 0*3)\n= i*(0 + 12\u221a3) - j*(-24 - 12) + k*(18\u221a3 - 0)\n= (12\u221a3)i - (-36)j + (18\u221a3)k\n= (12\u221a3, 36, 18\u221a3)\n\nSo, the normal vector is (12\u221a3, 36, 18\u221a3). We can simplify this by dividing by 6: (2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3). So, the plane equation is 2\u221a3(x - 6) + 6(y - 0) + 3\u221a3(z - 0) = 0. Wait, no, that's not the right way to write the plane equation.\n\nActually, the general plane equation is A(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0, where (A,B,C) is the normal vector and (x0,y0,z0) is a point on the plane. Let's use point A(6,0,0):\n\n12\u221a3(x - 6) + 36(y - 0) + 18\u221a3(z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n12\u221a3 x - 72\u221a3 + 36y + 18\u221a3 z = 0\n\nDivide all terms by 6 to simplify:\n\n2\u221a3 x - 12\u221a3 + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 0\n\nBring constants to the other side:\n\n2\u221a3 x + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 12\u221a3\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by \u221a3 to make it simpler:\n\n2x + (6/\u221a3)y + 3z = 12\n\nSimplify 6/\u221a3 to 2\u221a3:\n\n2x + 2\u221a3 y + 3z = 12\n\nSo, the plane equation is 2x + 2\u221a3 y + 3z = 12.\n\nNow, I need to find the intersection of this plane with the cylinder. The cylinder is defined by the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 = 36, since it's a right circular cylinder with radius 6.\n\nTo find the intersection curve, we can parametrize the cylinder and substitute into the plane equation.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the method of finding the cross-section. Since the plane is cutting through the cylinder, the cross-section should be an ellipse, but since the plane passes through the center, it might actually be a rectangle or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section of a cylinder with a plane is generally an ellipse, unless the plane is parallel to the side, in which case it's a rectangle. But in this case, the plane is passing through two points on the base and the center, so it's not parallel to the side. Therefore, the cross-section should be an ellipse.\n\nBut the problem says that the slicing reveals a flat, unpainted face on each half. So, each half has a new face, which is the cross-section. The area of this face is the area of the ellipse. But the problem states the area is \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\), which suggests it might not be a standard ellipse area.\n\nWait, actually, the cross-section when slicing a cylinder with a plane is an ellipse, whose area can be calculated as \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. But the problem's answer is given in the form \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\), which is different. So maybe the cross-section isn't an ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something. When you slice a cylinder with a plane, the cross-section is an ellipse unless the plane is parallel to the side, in which case it's a rectangle, or if the plane is tangent, in which case it's a line. But in this case, the plane passes through two points on the base and the center, so it's definitely not tangent, and it's not parallel to the side because it's passing through points on the base.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is an ellipse, but the area of the ellipse is \u03c0ab. However, the problem says the area is \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\), which is a combination of a multiple of \u03c0 and a square root term. That suggests that maybe the cross-section isn't an ellipse but another shape.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe the cross-section is a parallelogram because the plane is cutting through the top and bottom faces as well. Let me think.\n\nIf the plane passes through points A and B on the bottom face and the center, which is on the axis, then it also passes through the top face. So, the plane will intersect the top face at some points as well. Thus, the cross-section on each half will be a quadrilateral, perhaps a parallelogram.\n\nTo find the area, I need to find the shape of this cross-section. Let me try to find the intersection points of the plane with the top face of the cylinder.\n\nThe top face is at z=8. Let's plug z=8 into the plane equation:\n\n2x + 2\u221a3 y + 3*8 = 12\n2x + 2\u221a3 y + 24 = 12\n2x + 2\u221a3 y = -12\nDivide by 2:\nx + \u221a3 y = -6\n\nSo, on the top face at z=8, the intersection line is x + \u221a3 y = -6. But the top face is also a circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nSo, we can solve for x from the plane equation: x = -6 - \u221a3 y.\n\nSubstitute into the top face equation:\n\n(-6 - \u221a3 y)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36\n(36 + 12\u221a3 y + 3y\u00b2) + y\u00b2 = 36\n36 + 12\u221a3 y + 4y\u00b2 = 36\n12\u221a3 y + 4y\u00b2 = 0\nFactor out y:\ny(12\u221a3 + 4y) = 0\n\nSo, y = 0 or 12\u221a3 + 4y = 0 => y = -3\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the intersection points on the top face are when y=0: x = -6 - 0 = -6, so point D is (-6, 0, 8). And when y = -3\u221a3: x = -6 - \u221a3*(-3\u221a3) = -6 + 9 = 3, so point E is (3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nSo, on the top face, the plane intersects at points D(-6, 0, 8) and E(3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nSimilarly, on the bottom face, the plane intersects at points A(6,0,0) and B(-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nTherefore, the cross-section on the bottom half is a quadrilateral with vertices A(6,0,0), B(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), E(3, -3\u221a3, 8), and D(-6, 0, 8). Wait, that doesn't seem right because connecting A to B to E to D would make a four-sided figure, but I need to check the connections.\n\nWait, actually, the slicing plane passes through A, B, and the center, so on the bottom, it's the line AB, and on the top, it's the line DE. Since the plane is straight, the cross-section on each half is a quadrilateral, specifically a parallelogram because the sides are parallel.\n\nWait, let me check if the sides are parallel. The vector from A to B is B - A = (-3 - 6, 3\u221a3 - 0, 0 - 0) = (-9, 3\u221a3, 0). The vector from D to E is E - D = (3 - (-6), -3\u221a3 - 0, 8 - 8) = (9, -3\u221a3, 0). So, these vectors are negatives of each other, meaning they are parallel but in opposite directions. Similarly, the vector from B to E is E - B = (3 - (-3), -3\u221a3 - 3\u221a3, 8 - 0) = (6, -6\u221a3, 8). The vector from A to D is D - A = (-6 - 6, 0 - 0, 8 - 0) = (-12, 0, 8). Wait, these don't seem parallel. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a parallelogram because the sides AB and DE are parallel, and sides AE and BD are parallel. Let me check.\n\nWait, point A is (6,0,0), point E is (3, -3\u221a3, 8). So, vector AE is (-3, -3\u221a3, 8). Point B is (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), point D is (-6, 0, 8). Vector BD is (-3, -3\u221a3, 8). So, vectors AE and BD are equal, meaning sides AE and BD are equal and parallel. Similarly, vectors AB and ED: AB is (-9, 3\u221a3, 0), ED is (3 - (-6), -3\u221a3 - 0, 8 - 8) = (9, -3\u221a3, 0). So, AB and ED are negatives, meaning they are parallel but opposite in direction. So, yes, the cross-section is a parallelogram with sides AB and AE, which are vectors.\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram can be found by the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AE.\n\nLet me compute vectors AB and AE.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-3 - 6, 3\u221a3 - 0, 0 - 0) = (-9, 3\u221a3, 0)\nVector AE = E - A = (3 - 6, -3\u221a3 - 0, 8 - 0) = (-3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nNow, the cross product AB \u00d7 AE is:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-9 \u00a03\u221a3 \u00a00|\n|-3 -3\u221a3 \u00a08|\n\n= i*(3\u221a3*8 - 0*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-9*8 - 0*(-3)) + k*(-9*(-3\u221a3) - 3\u221a3*(-3))\n= i*(24\u221a3 - 0) - j*(-72 - 0) + k*(27\u221a3 + 9\u221a3)\n= (24\u221a3)i - (-72)j + (36\u221a3)k\n= (24\u221a3, 72, 36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is:\n\n\u221a[(24\u221a3)^2 + 72^2 + (36\u221a3)^2]\n= \u221a[(24^2 * 3) + 72^2 + (36^2 * 3)]\n= \u221a[(576 * 3) + 5184 + (1296 * 3)]\n= \u221a[1728 + 5184 + 3888]\n= \u221a[1728 + 5184 = 6912; 6912 + 3888 = 10800]\n= \u221a10800\n= \u221a(100 * 108)\n= 10\u221a108\n= 10\u221a(36*3)\n= 10*6\u221a3\n= 60\u221a3\n\nSo, the area of the parallelogram is 60\u221a3. Therefore, the area is 0\u03c0 + 60\u221a3, so a=0, b=60, c=3. Thus, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac. In my calculation, I got 60\u221a3, which is just the b\u221ac term. So, a is 0. Is that acceptable? The problem says a, b, c are integers, and c is square-free, which it is (3 is prime). So, 60\u221a3 is in the correct form with a=0, b=60, c=3. So, the answer is 63.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the cross-section is a parallelogram, and the area is 60\u221a3. I thought initially it might be an ellipse, but since the cross-section is a parallelogram, the area calculation makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the area of the parallelogram is base times height. The base is AB, which is 6\u221a3, and the height is the distance from the plane to the opposite side. Wait, no, that's not straightforward because the height isn't just along the z-axis. Instead, the height in the parallelogram is the component of the vector AE perpendicular to AB.\n\nBut since we already calculated the cross product, which gives the area directly, that's the more straightforward method.\n\nSo, I think my final answer is 63, corresponding to a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{63}\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a right circular cylinder with radius 6 and height 8, which has been entirely painted blue.

      "initial_reasoning": "Okay, so I have this AIME problem about a block of wood shaped like a right circular cylinder. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 8. The entire surface is painted blue. Points A and B are on the edge of one of the circular faces, and the arc AB on that face measures 120 degrees. Then, the block is sliced in half along a plane that passes through points A, B, and the center of the cylinder. This slicing reveals a flat, unpainted face on each half. The problem asks for the area of one of these unpainted faces, which is given in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, where a, b, and c are integers, and c is not divisible by the square of any prime. Then, I need to find a + b + c.\n\nAlright, so first, let me visualize this. There's a cylinder with radius 6 and height 8. The entire surface is painted, so the lateral surface and the two circular faces are all blue. Points A and B are on the edge of one circular face, with an arc AB of 120 degrees. So, the angle between them is 120 degrees. Then, the cylinder is sliced through A, B, and the center, resulting in two halves, each with an unpainted face.\n\nI need to find the area of one of these unpainted faces.\n\nHmm. So, the plane that slices the cylinder passes through A, B, and the center. Since A and B are on the edge of the circular face, and the center is the center of the cylinder, this plane is cutting through the cylinder.\n\nI should probably figure out the shape of this unpainted face. Since it's a slice through the cylinder, it's going to be a flat surface. The shape of this surface is likely a portion of an ellipse or perhaps a triangle or something else.\n\nWait, when you slice a cylinder with a plane, the cross-section is an ellipse unless the plane is parallel to the side, in which case it's a rectangle, or perpendicular, which would be a circle. But in this case, the plane is passing through two points on the circumference of a circular face and the center, so the cross-section is probably an ellipse.\n\nWait, but actually, let me think again. The plane passes through points A, B, and the center of the cylinder. Since A and B are on the circumference of the circular face, and the center is the center of the cylinder, this plane is going to pass through the axis of the cylinder, right? Because the center is on the axis.\n\nWait, but if the plane passes through the axis, then the cross-section might actually be a rectangle or a parallelogram? No, because it's passing through the axis, which is a straight line, so the intersection of the plane with the cylinder should be an ellipse. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, if the plane contains the axis of the cylinder, then the cross-section is a rectangle, isn't it? Because the intersection of a plane containing the axis of a cylinder is a rectangle. Hmm, but in this case, the plane is passing through points A, B, and the center. Points A and B are on the circular face, but the plane also passes through the center.\n\nWait, so if the plane contains the axis (since it passes through the center and through points on the circumference), then the cross-section is a rectangle. But the problem says the area is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that it's a combination of a circular segment and something else. Hmm, maybe not a rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again. The cylinder is a right circular cylinder, so its cross-section when sliced by a plane that contains its axis is indeed a rectangle. The height of the rectangle would be the height of the cylinder, 8, and the width would be the diameter of the base, which is 12. So, the area would be 12 * 8 = 96. But in the problem, the unpainted face is a flat, unpainted face, and the area is given as a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which doesn't look like 96. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the plane doesn't contain the axis? Let me check. Points A and B are on the edge of one circular face, and the plane passes through A, B, and the center. The center is the center of the cylinder, which is on the axis. So, the plane does contain the axis because it contains the center and passes through A and B, which are on the circumference. So, the cross-section should be a rectangle.\n\nBut that contradicts the problem's statement about the area being in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, perhaps I'm wrong about the shape of the cross-section.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is not a rectangle but a different shape. Let me try to model this.\n\nImagine the cylinder with radius 6, height 8. Let's place it in a coordinate system where the axis of the cylinder is along the z-axis, from (0,0,0) to (0,0,8). The circular face on the bottom is at z=0, and the top face is at z=8.\n\nPoints A and B are on the edge of the bottom circular face, which is the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 in the plane z=0. The arc AB measures 120 degrees, so the angle between points A and B as viewed from the center is 120 degrees. So, if I parameterize points A and B on the circle, let's say point A is at (6, 0, 0). Then, since the arc AB is 120 degrees, point B would be 120 degrees around the circle from A.\n\nIn coordinates, point B can be represented as (6 cos 120\u00b0, 6 sin 120\u00b0, 0). Calculating that, cos 120\u00b0 is -1/2, and sin 120\u00b0 is \u221a3/2. So, point B is at (6*(-1/2), 6*(\u221a3/2), 0) = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nWait, but hold on. If point A is at (6,0,0), moving 120 degrees counterclockwise would bring us to (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). But in the Asymptote code, it shows points A and B on the same face, but the code might have a different coordinate system.\n\nBut regardless, points A and B are on the circumference, 120 degrees apart, and the plane passes through A, B, and the center (0,0,0). So, the plane is defined by three points: A, B, and the origin.\n\nGiven that, the cross-section is the intersection of this plane with the cylinder. Let's figure out the shape of this cross-section.\n\nWait, since the plane passes through the axis (the origin), the cross-section should be a rectangle, as I thought earlier. But the problem says the area is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests a different shape.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. The plane passes through points A, B, and the center, but the cross-section is not just the flat face but perhaps includes some curved parts?\n\nWait, no. When you slice a cylinder with a plane, the intersection is a conic section. If the plane is not parallel to the side, it's an ellipse. But if the plane contains the axis, it's a rectangle.\n\nWait, but in this case, the plane contains the axis, so the cross-section is a rectangle, right? So, maybe the area is 12*8=96, but the problem says it's a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac. Hmm, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the slicing is not through the entire cylinder, but only through half of it? But no, the block is sliced in half, so each half would have a flat face.\n\nWait, maybe the unpainted face is not the cross-section but the union of the cross-section and some other part?\n\nWait, no. When you slice the cylinder, the newly exposed face is just the cross-section of the plane with the cylinder. So, if the cross-section is a rectangle, the area should be 12*8=96. But the problem says it's a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so maybe I'm wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is not a rectangle but a different shape because the plane is not passing through the entire cylinder? Wait, no, the plane passes through the entire cylinder, slicing it into two halves.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is actually a parallelogram instead of a rectangle? But if the plane is passing through the axis, which is straight, then the cross-section should be a rectangle.\n\nWait, maybe I need to parametrize the plane equation and find the intersection with the cylinder.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, let's place the cylinder in a coordinate system with its axis along the z-axis, from (0,0,0) to (0,0,8). The circular face at z=0 has equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nPoints A and B are on this circle, separated by a 120-degree arc. Let me take point A as (6,0,0) as before, so point B is at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nThe plane passes through A (6,0,0), B (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and the origin (0,0,0). So, the plane is defined by these three points.\n\nTo find the equation of the plane, let's find two vectors in the plane:\n\nVector OA = A - origin = (6,0,0)\nVector OB = B - origin = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nThe normal vector to the plane can be found by taking the cross product of OA and OB.\n\nCalculating the cross product:\n\nOA \u00d7 OB = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a00\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-3 3\u221a3 \u00a00\n\n= i*(0*0 - 0*3\u221a3) - j*(6*0 - 0*(-3)) + k*(6*3\u221a3 - 0*(-3))\n\n= i*(0 - 0) - j*(0 - 0) + k*(18\u221a3 - 0)\n\n= (0, 0, 18\u221a3)\n\nSo, the normal vector is (0, 0, 18\u221a3), which simplifies to (0, 0, 1) when normalized.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the cross product is (0,0,18\u221a3), then the normal vector is in the positive z-direction. But the plane containing points A, B, and the origin is not horizontal; it's slanting.\n\nWait, but according to the cross product, the normal vector is along the z-axis, which would mean the plane is horizontal, but that's not the case because points A and B are on the z=0 plane, and the origin is also on z=0. So, the plane is the z=0 plane itself? But that can't be, because point A is (6,0,0), B is (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and origin is (0,0,0), so yes, all three points lie on the z=0 plane.\n\nWait, that's not correct because the problem says the block is sliced in half along the plane that passes through A, B, and the center, revealing an unpainted face on each half. But if the plane is z=0, then it's the base of the cylinder, which was already painted. So, that can't be the case.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the coordinate system. Maybe the center is at (0,0,4) instead of (0,0,0). Wait, the height is 8, so the center would be at (0,0,4). So, perhaps I need to adjust the coordinate system.\n\nLet me reorient the cylinder so that the center is at (0,0,4), with the bottom face at z=0 and the top face at z=8. Then, point A is on the bottom face at (6,0,0), point B is at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and the center is at (0,0,4).\n\nSo, now, the plane passes through A (6,0,0), B (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and the center (0,0,4). So, three points not all on the same z-plane, so the plane is tilted.\n\nAlright, so let's find the equation of the plane passing through these three points.\n\nPoints:\nA: (6,0,0)\nB: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\nC: (0,0,4)\n\nWe can find two vectors in the plane:\nVector AC = C - A = (-6, 0, 4)\nVector BC = C - B = (3, -3\u221a3, 4)\n\nNow, the normal vector to the plane is the cross product of AC and BC.\n\nCalculating the cross product:\n\nAC \u00d7 BC = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-6 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a04\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03 -3\u221a3 \u00a04\n\n= i*(0*4 - 4*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-6*4 - 4*3) + k*(-6*(-3\u221a3) - 0*3)\n\n= i*(0 + 12\u221a3) - j*(-24 - 12) + k*(18\u221a3 - 0)\n\n= (12\u221a3)i - (-36)j + 18\u221a3 k\n\n= (12\u221a3, 36, 18\u221a3)\n\nWe can simplify this normal vector by dividing by 6:\n\n(2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3)\n\nSo, the equation of the plane is:\n\n2\u221a3(x - 6) + 6(y - 0) + 3\u221a3(z - 0) = 0\n\nWait, using point A (6,0,0) to plug into the plane equation.\n\nSo,\n\n2\u221a3(x - 6) + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n2\u221a3 x - 12\u221a3 + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 0\n\nBring constants to the other side:\n\n2\u221a3 x + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 12\u221a3\n\nWe can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n(2\u221a3/3)x + 2y + \u221a3 z = 4\u221a3\n\nAlternatively, write it as:\n\n2\u221a3 x + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 12\u221a3\n\nEither way, that's the plane equation.\n\nNow, to find the intersection of this plane with the cylinder.\n\nThe cylinder has equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36, and z goes from 0 to 8.\n\nWe can parametrize the intersection curve by expressing z in terms of x and y.\n\nFrom the plane equation:\n\n2\u221a3 x + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 12\u221a3\n\nLet me solve for z:\n\n3\u221a3 z = 12\u221a3 - 2\u221a3 x - 6y\n\nDivide both sides by 3\u221a3:\n\nz = (12\u221a3 - 2\u221a3 x - 6y)/(3\u221a3)\n\nSimplify:\n\nz = (12\u221a3)/(3\u221a3) - (2\u221a3 x)/(3\u221a3) - (6y)/(3\u221a3)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n12\u221a3 / (3\u221a3) = 4\n- (2\u221a3 x)/(3\u221a3) = - (2x)/3\n- (6y)/(3\u221a3) = - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nSo, z = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nTherefore, the intersection curve is given by:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36\nz = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nSo, to find the shape of the intersection, we can substitute z into the cylinder equation, but it's already given.\n\nWait, but to find the area of the unpainted face, which is the cross-section, I need to compute the area of this intersection.\n\nBut the cross-section is an ellipse because the intersection of a plane and a cylinder is an ellipse unless the plane is parallel to the side, which would give a rectangle, or perpendicular, which would give a circle.\n\nBut in this case, the plane is tilted, so the intersection is an ellipse.\n\nSo, the area of the unpainted face is the area of this ellipse.\n\nWait, but how do I compute the area of this ellipse?\n\nI know that when a plane intersects a cylinder, the area of the ellipse can be found using the formula:\n\nArea = (circumference of the base circle) * (length along the axis) / (something?)\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Alternatively, the area can be found by considering the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nAlternatively, the area can be found by parametrizing the ellipse and computing the area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the area using the parametrization.\n\nWait, let's recall that the area of an ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the area of the cross-section can be found by taking the area of the base circle and scaling it by the factor related to the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, actually, in general, when a plane intersects a cylinder at an angle \u03b8 with respect to the axis, the area of the cross-section is (circumference) * (height) / sin \u03b8 or something like that. Wait, no, that's for the lateral surface area.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the area of the ellipse.\n\nThe area of the ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis.\n\nBut how to find a and b?\n\nAlternatively, since the cross-section is an ellipse, we can find its major and minor axes by finding the points where the plane intersects the cylinder.\n\nWait, but maybe it's easier to compute the area using a parameterization.\n\nLet me try to parametrize the ellipse.\n\nWe can parametrize the cylinder as:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = z\n\nBut we also have the plane equation:\n\nz = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nSo, substituting x and y:\n\nz = 4 - (2*(6 cos \u03b8))/3 - (2*(6 sin \u03b8))/\u221a3\n= 4 - (12 cos \u03b8)/3 - (12 sin \u03b8)/\u221a3\n= 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - (12 sin \u03b8)/\u221a3\n\nSimplify:\n\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nSo, the parametrization of the intersection curve is:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nThis is a parametrization of the ellipse.\n\nNow, to find the area of the ellipse, I can use the formula for the area of a parametric surface.\n\nWait, but this is a curve, not a surface. Hmm, perhaps I need another approach.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the area by integrating over the parameter \u03b8.\n\nBut the area of the ellipse is a fixed number, so maybe I can find it using the parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to compute the angle between the plane and the axis of the cylinder and then use that to find the scaling factor for the area.\n\nWait, the area of the cross-section (the ellipse) is equal to the area of the base circle divided by cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nWait, actually, when you have a slant cut, the area of the cross-section is equal to the area of the base circle divided by cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the cutting plane and the axis.\n\nWait, but in this case, the cross-section is an ellipse, and the area is \u03c0ab.\n\nBut the base circle has radius 6, so its area is 36\u03c0.\n\nIf the plane is inclined at an angle \u03b8 to the axis, then the area of the ellipse is (36\u03c0)/cos \u03b8.\n\nWait, is that the case?\n\nWait, actually, when you have a cylinder and you slice it at an angle \u03b8, the area of the cross-section is equal to the area of the base circle divided by cos \u03b8. So, yes, Area = 36\u03c0 / cos \u03b8.\n\nTherefore, if I can find \u03b8, the angle between the plane and the axis, then I can compute the area as 36\u03c0 / cos \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find cos \u03b8, then I can compute the area.\n\nSo, how to find \u03b8?\n\n\u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis of the cylinder.\n\nWait, the angle between the plane and the axis can be found by taking the angle between the normal vector of the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, the angle between the plane and the axis is equal to 90 degrees minus the angle between the normal vector and the axis.\n\nWait, let me recall that the angle between a plane and a line is equal to the complement of the angle between the normal vector and the line.\n\nSo, if \u03c6 is the angle between the normal vector and the axis, then \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - \u03c6.\n\nSo, to find \u03b8, I can compute \u03c6 first.\n\nGiven that, let's compute \u03c6, the angle between the normal vector of the plane and the axis.\n\nThe normal vector of the plane is (2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3). The axis of the cylinder is along the vector (0,0,8), which can be represented as (0,0,1) for direction.\n\nThe angle \u03c6 between the normal vector and the axis can be found using the dot product:\n\ncos \u03c6 = (normal vector \u00b7 axis) / (|normal vector| |axis|)\n\nCompute the dot product:\n\n(2\u221a3)(0) + (6)(0) + (3\u221a3)(1) = 3\u221a3\n\nCompute |normal vector|:\n\n|normal vector| = sqrt( (2\u221a3)^2 + 6^2 + (3\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt( 12 + 36 + 27 ) = sqrt(75) = 5\u221a3\n\nCompute |axis| = 1 (since we're using the unit vector (0,0,1))\n\nSo, cos \u03c6 = (3\u221a3) / (5\u221a3) = 3/5\n\nTherefore, \u03c6 = arccos(3/5)\n\nTherefore, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - \u03c6\n\nSo, cos \u03b8 = sin \u03c6\n\nSince sin \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6) = sqrt(1 - 9/25) = sqrt(16/25) = 4/5\n\nTherefore, cos \u03b8 = 4/5\n\nSo, the area of the cross-section is 36\u03c0 / cos \u03b8 = 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 36\u03c0 * (5/4) = 45\u03c0\n\nWait, that's a nice number, but the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, 45\u03c0 would mean b=0, but in the problem, it's specified that the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is not 45\u03c0. Let me verify.\n\nWait, another way to compute the area of the ellipse is to use the parametrization and compute the area using the formula for the area of a parametric curve.\n\nWait, no, the area of the cross-section is the area of the ellipse, which can be found by scaling the area of the base circle by 1/cos \u03b8, as I did before. But according to that, it's 45\u03c0, which is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with b=0. But the problem says both a and b are integers, and c is square-free. So, perhaps 45\u03c0 is the area, and then a=45, b=0, c=0, but c=0 is not square-free. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps my approach is incorrect because the cross-section is not an ellipse? Wait, no, slicing a cylinder with a plane at an angle should give an ellipse.\n\nWait, but in this case, the plane passes through the center, so maybe it's a different kind of cross-section.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe the cross-section is a triangle or a quadrilateral?\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a continuous curve, so it's either a circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, etc. Since the plane is not parallel to the side, nor cutting through the apex, it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, so why does the problem say the area is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac? Maybe my calculation is wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again about the area formula. Maybe instead of dividing by cos \u03b8, it's not that straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is not just the ellipse but also includes some part of the original painted surface?\n\nWait, no, the unpainted face is just the cross-section. So, it should be the area of the ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area of the ellipse differently.\n\nWait, the area of an ellipse is \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes.\n\nAlternatively, if I can find the lengths of the major and minor axes, I can compute the area.\n\nAlternatively, since the cylinder is being cut by a plane, the intersection is an ellipse whose major axis is the diameter of the cylinder divided by cos \u03b8, and the minor axis remains the same as the diameter.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of the cross-section can be found by computing the area of the parallelogram formed by the intersection.\n\nWait, but it's an ellipse, not a parallelogram.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area by using the parametrization and integrating over \u03b8.\n\nGiven the parametrization:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nBut how does that help me find the area?\n\nWait, actually, the cross-section is a closed curve, so the area can be found by using the formula for the area of a parametric curve in 3D.\n\nWait, but I think the formula for the area of a parametric surface is different. Wait, no, for a parametric curve, it's just the length, not the area.\n\nWait, perhaps I can project the ellipse onto a plane where it's easier to compute the area.\n\nWait, if I can find a coordinate system where the ellipse becomes a circle, then the area would be \u03c0r\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since the ellipse is the intersection of the plane and the cylinder, and the cylinder has radius 6, the semi-minor axis of the ellipse is 6, and the semi-major axis can be found based on the angle.\n\nWait, the semi-minor axis is the same as the radius of the cylinder, which is 6, and the semi-major axis is 6 / cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, but earlier, I found cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so the semi-major axis would be 6 / (4/5) = 6 * (5/4) = 30/4 = 15/2 = 7.5.\n\nTherefore, the area would be \u03c0 * (15/2) * 6 = \u03c0 * (90/2) = 45\u03c0. So, same result as before.\n\nSo, perhaps the area is 45\u03c0, which would be a=45, b=0, c=0, but c is supposed to be square-free and non-zero. So, maybe I'm still missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section isn't the entire ellipse, but only a part of it?\n\nWait, no, when you slice the cylinder through A, B, and the center, you're cutting through the entire cylinder, so the cross-section is a full ellipse.\n\nWait, but the problem says the block is sliced in half, so the unpainted face is half of the ellipse? Wait, no, slicing along a plane divides the cylinder into two halves, each with an unpainted face, which is the cross-section. So, each half has an entire ellipse as its unpainted face.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac\". So, 45\u03c0 would be the area, which is of the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with b=0, but c must be square-free. So, 0 is not allowed for c? Wait, c is in the term b\u221ac, so if b=0, then the term is 0, and c can be anything, but the problem says c is not divisible by the square of any prime, which is vacuous if b=0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written as \"a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac\", so it's possible that b could be zero, but c is still square-free. However, in the problem, they might have meant that c is non-zero and square-free, but the problem statement doesn't specify that. So, perhaps 45\u03c0 is acceptable, with a=45, b=0, c=0, but c=0 is not square-free.\n\nWait, 0 is divisible by every prime squared, so it's not square-free. Therefore, c must be non-zero and square-free. So, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, let me think again. When you slice a cylinder with a plane that passes through two points on the base and the center, the cross-section is actually a rectangle, but in this case, since the plane is not vertical, it's a parallelogram.\n\nWait, no, because the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, so it's a rectangle if the plane is vertical.\n\nWait, but in this case, the plane is not vertical because it's tilted. Wait, in the coordinate system, the plane passes through (6,0,0), (-3,3\u221a3,0), and (0,0,4). So, it's a slant plane.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle, but the sides are not straight up and down.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is a rectangle with one side being the chord AB on the base and the other side being the line from the center to the top.\n\nWait, but no, the plane slices through the entire cylinder, so the cross-section is actually a rectangle, but the sides are slanting.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with sides of length equal to the chord AB and the height of the cylinder.\n\nWait, chord AB on the base has length 2*6*sin(60\u00b0) = 12*(\u221a3/2) = 6\u221a3.\n\nSo, chord AB is 6\u221a3, and the height is 8. So, the cross-section would be a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 8, so the area would be 48\u221a3.\n\nBut in the problem, the area is given as a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, 48\u221a3 would be a=0, b=48, c=3, which are integers, and c=3 is square-free. Then, a + b + c = 0 + 48 + 3 = 51.\n\nBut wait, if the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 8, then the area is 48\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=48, c=3.\n\nBut in that case, the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so 0 is allowed for a? The problem doesn't specify that a, b, c are non-zero, just that c is square-free.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the cross-section was an ellipse, but if the cross-section is a rectangle, then the area is 48\u221a3.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When you slice a cylinder with a plane that contains the axis, the cross-section is a rectangle. But in this case, the plane does not contain the axis, because the center is at (0,0,4), not on the z=0 plane.\n\nWait, no, the plane passes through the center (0,0,4), point A (6,0,0), and point B (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). So, the plane is not horizontal, and it doesn't contain the axis because the axis is the line from (0,0,0) to (0,0,8). The plane passes through (0,0,4), which is the midpoint, but not the entire axis.\n\nWait, but the plane passes through the center (0,0,4), which is on the axis, and through points A and B on the base. So, the plane contains the center and points A and B, which are on the circumference of the base.\n\nWait, but the axis is from (0,0,0) to (0,0,8). So, the plane passes through (0,0,4), which is on the axis, but not through the entire axis.\n\nSo, in that case, the cross-section is an ellipse.\n\nWait, so earlier, I thought it was a rectangle, but actually, it's an ellipse because the plane doesn't contain the entire axis.\n\nWait, but the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, but only one point on the axis.\n\nWait, so the cross-section is an ellipse.\n\nTherefore, going back, the area is 45\u03c0, but the problem says a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac. So, perhaps my previous approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area differently.\n\nWait, another approach: The cross-section is an ellipse, and its area can be computed using the formula involving the determinant of a matrix formed by vectors in the plane.\n\nWait, the area of the ellipse can be found by computing the area scaling factor when projecting from the cylinder to the plane.\n\nAlternatively, since the cross-section is an ellipse, the area can be found by calculating the area of the parallelogram formed by two vectors on the plane and then dividing by the sine of the angle between them or something.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the area of a parametric surface.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a curve, not a surface.\n\nWait, perhaps the area can be found by computing the magnitude of the cross product of the tangent vectors.\n\nWait, but that's for surfaces. For a curve, the area isn't directly defined.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the formula for the area of an ellipse given by a parametrization.\n\nWait, if I have the parametrization of the ellipse, I can compute the area using a line integral.\n\nWait, yes, the area can be computed using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) \u222b(x dy - y dx)\n\nBut since this is a closed curve, I can use Green's theorem.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nGiven the parametrization:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nBut for the area, since it's an ellipse in 3D, I need to project it onto a 2D plane.\n\nWait, perhaps I can parameterize the ellipse in 2D.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to find the major and minor axes.\n\nWait, since the cross-section is an ellipse, and we have the parametrization, maybe we can find the maximum and minimum distances from the center.\n\nWait, the ellipse is centered at some point?\n\nWait, no, the plane cuts through the cylinder, so the ellipse is centered at the center of the cylinder?\n\nWait, not necessarily. Wait, the plane passes through the center of the cylinder, which is at (0,0,4). So, the ellipse is centered at (0,0,4).\n\nWait, so the ellipse is in the plane z = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3, centered at (0,0,4).\n\nWait, to find the major and minor axes, perhaps I can find the points on the ellipse farthest from the center.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps it's better to perform a coordinate transformation to align the plane with a coordinate plane.\n\nWait, let's try to find a coordinate system where the plane becomes the xy-plane, then the ellipse would be easier to analyze.\n\nBut that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the area by using the parametrization.\n\nWait, since the parametrization is:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\n\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\n\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nI can think of this as a parametric curve in 3D, and the area of the ellipse can be found by computing the integral over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nWait, but I need a way to compute the area of the ellipse from this parametrization.\n\nWait, I found a formula online that says the area of a parametric ellipse can be found by integrating over the parameter, but I can't remember exactly.\n\nWait, another idea: The ellipse is the image of the unit circle under a linear transformation.\n\nWait, if I can express the parametrization as a linear transformation of the unit circle, then the area would be the determinant of the transformation matrix.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nLet me define a parameter t such that:\n\nx = 6 cos t\n\ny = 6 sin t\n\nThen, z = 4 - 4 cos t - 4\u221a3 sin t\n\nBut z is dependent on t, so this is a curve in 3D.\n\nWait, but to find the area of the ellipse, I need to consider the mapping from the parameter t to the ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the ellipse as a parameterized surface in 3D, but it's actually a curve.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. The cross-section is an ellipse, and the area can be found by computing the length of the major and minor axes.\n\nWait, to find the major and minor axes, I can find the points on the ellipse that are farthest from the center.\n\nWait, the ellipse is in the plane z = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3.\n\nWait, the center of the ellipse is at the point where the plane intersects the axis of the cylinder, which is at (0,0,4).\n\nWait, so the center is (0,0,4). Then, the ellipse is centered at (0,0,4).\n\nSo, to find the major and minor axes, I can find the points on the ellipse that are farthest along the direction of the plane's normal vector and the direction perpendicular to it.\n\nWait, perhaps the major axis is in the direction of the projection of the cylinder's axis onto the plane.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe I can compute the area by using the fact that the area of the ellipse is equal to the area of the base circle times the ratio of the height in the direction perpendicular to the plane.\n\nWait, let me think.\n\nThe area of the ellipse can be found by considering the scaling factor due to the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nWait, the area of the ellipse is equal to the area of the base circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nEarlier, I found that the angle \u03b8 between the plane and the axis satisfies cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so the area would be 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that there is a radical term, so perhaps 45\u03c0 is not the correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe my initial assumption that the cross-section is an ellipse is wrong, and instead, the cross-section is a different shape.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the area by another method.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a triangle.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a continuous curve, so it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is not just 45\u03c0, but includes some other term.\n\nWait, another idea: The unpainted face is not just the cross-section but also includes some part of the lateral surface.\n\nWait, but the problem says the block is sliced in half, revealing a flat, unpainted face on each half. So, it's just the cross-section.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area of the ellipse correctly.\n\nWait, another approach: The area of the ellipse can be computed as the area of the parallelogram formed by vectors in the plane.\n\nWait, since the cross-section is an ellipse, which is a stretched circle, the area is the area of the circle times the scaling factor.\n\nWait, in this case, the circle has radius 6, so area 36\u03c0. The scaling factor is the factor by which the plane is inclined relative to the axis.\n\nWait, so the scaling factor is 1 / cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nEarlier, I found that cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so the scaling factor is 5/4.\n\nTherefore, the area is 36\u03c0 * (5/4) = 45\u03c0.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my previous result.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that it's a combination of a \u03c0 term and a radical term.\n\nSo, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait, maybe the cross-section is not just an ellipse but also includes some other geometric shape.\n\nWait, perhaps the unpainted face is a combination of a sector of the circle and a triangle or something else.\n\nWait, no, when you slice the cylinder, the cross-section is just the intersection curve, which is an ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps the area is computed differently.\n\nWait, maybe I need to compute the area using the plane's equation and the cylinder's equation.\n\nSo, the intersection curve is given by:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36\n\nz = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nSo, we can express y in terms of x and z, or x in terms of y and z.\n\nWait, but how does that help in computing the area?\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area by integrating over x and y.\n\nWait, the area can be found by computing the double integral over the region in the plane.\n\nWait, but that might be complicated.\n\nWait, another idea: The area of the ellipse can be found by computing the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors defining the ellipse.\n\nWait, if I can find two orthonormal vectors in the plane, I can compute the area.\n\nWait, let me try that.\n\nWe have the plane with normal vector n = (2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3). Let's find two orthonormal vectors in the plane.\n\nFirst, let's find two vectors in the plane:\n\nVector v1 = A - C = (6,0,0) - (0,0,4) = (6,0,-4)\n\nVector v2 = B - C = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0) - (0,0,4) = (-3, 3\u221a3, -4)\n\nNow, we can use these vectors to form a basis for the plane.\n\nFirst, normalize v1:\n\n|v1| = sqrt(6\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + (-4)\u00b2) = sqrt(36 + 16) = sqrt(52) = 2\u221a13\n\nSo, unit vector u1 = (6/(2\u221a13), 0, -4/(2\u221a13)) = (3/\u221a13, 0, -2/\u221a13)\n\nNext, find a vector orthogonal to u1 in the plane.\n\nTake v2 and subtract its projection onto u1.\n\nCompute projection of v2 onto u1:\n\nproj_u1(v2) = (v2 \u00b7 u1) u1\n\nv2 \u00b7 u1 = (-3)(3/\u221a13) + (3\u221a3)(0) + (-4)(-2/\u221a13) = (-9/\u221a13) + 0 + (8/\u221a13) = (-1)/\u221a13\n\nSo, proj_u1(v2) = (-1/\u221a13) * (3/\u221a13, 0, -2/\u221a13) = (-3/13, 0, 2/13)\n\nThen, the orthogonal component is v2 - proj_u1(v2):\n\nv2_orth = (-3, 3\u221a3, -4) - (-3/13, 0, 2/13) = (-3 + 3/13, 3\u221a3 - 0, -4 - 2/13) = (-36/13, 3\u221a3, -54/13)\n\nNow, normalize v2_orth:\n\n|v2_orth| = sqrt( (-36/13)^2 + (3\u221a3)^2 + (-54/13)^2 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(-36/13)^2 = (1296)/(169)\n(3\u221a3)^2 = 27\n(-54/13)^2 = (2916)/(169)\n\nSo, |v2_orth| = sqrt(1296/169 + 27 + 2916/169)\n\nConvert 27 to 27*169/169 = 4563/169\n\nSo,\n\n|v2_orth| = sqrt( (1296 + 4563 + 2916)/169 ) = sqrt( (1296 + 2916 = 4212; 4212 + 4563 = 8775 ) / 169 )\n\n= sqrt(8775 / 169) = sqrt(8775)/13\n\nFactor 8775: 8775 \u00f7 25 = 351; 351 \u00f7 9 = 39; 39 \u00f7 13 = 3. So, 8775 = 25 * 9 * 13 * 3 = 25 * 9 * 39\n\nSo, sqrt(8775) = sqrt(25 * 9 * 39) = 5 * 3 * sqrt(39) = 15\u221a39\n\nTherefore, |v2_orth| = 15\u221a39 / 13\n\nSo, unit vector u2 = ( (-36/13) / (15\u221a39 /13 ), (3\u221a3) / (15\u221a39 /13 ), (-54/13) / (15\u221a39 /13 ) )\n\nSimplify each component:\n\nFirst component: (-36/13) / (15\u221a39 /13 ) = (-36)/(15\u221a39) = (-12)/(5\u221a39) = (-12\u221a39)/(5*39) = (-12\u221a39)/195 = (-4\u221a39)/65\n\nSecond component: (3\u221a3) / (15\u221a39 /13 ) = (3\u221a3 * 13) / (15\u221a39 ) = (39\u221a3) / (15\u221a39 ) = (13\u221a3)/(5\u221a39 ) = (13\u221a3)/(5\u221a39 ) = (13\u221a(3/39))/5 = (13\u221a(1/13))/5 = (13/(\u221a13))/5 = (\u221a13)/5\n\nThird component: (-54/13) / (15\u221a39 /13 ) = (-54)/(15\u221a39 ) = (-18)/(5\u221a39 ) = (-18\u221a39)/(5*39) = (-18\u221a39)/195 = (-6\u221a39)/65\n\nTherefore, unit vector u2 = ( (-4\u221a39)/65, \u221a13/5, (-6\u221a39)/65 )\n\nNow, with u1 and u2 as orthonormal vectors in the plane, the area of the ellipse can be found by the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors when transformed from the cylinder's base.\n\nWait, actually, the area of the ellipse is equal to the area of the base circle times the scaling factor due to the angle.\n\nBut since we have the orthonormal basis, the area scaling factor is the determinant of the transformation matrix.\n\nWait, the area of the ellipse is equal to the area of the unit circle times the determinant of the matrix formed by the transformation vectors.\n\nBut in this case, the transformation is from the base circle to the ellipse in the plane.\n\nWait, the area is equal to the area of the base circle times the square root of the determinant of the matrix product of the transformation.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the area can be found by the product of the lengths of u1 and u2, but since they are orthonormal, that product is 1.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The area of the ellipse can be found by the formula:\n\nArea = (1 / |n \u00b7 k| ) * (Area of base circle)\n\nWhere k is the unit vector in the z-direction.\n\nWait, let's compute n \u00b7 k, where n is the normal vector.\n\nn = (2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3)\n\nk = (0,0,1)\n\nn \u00b7 k = 3\u221a3\n\n|n \u00b7 k| = 3\u221a3\n\nTherefore, Area = (1 / 3\u221a3 ) * 36\u03c0 = 12\u03c0 / \u221a3 = 4\u03c0\u221a3\n\nWait, that's different. 4\u03c0\u221a3.\n\nWait, but let's verify this.\n\nWait, the formula for the area of the cross-section when slicing a cylinder with a plane is Area = (Area of base) / |cos \u03b8|, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nBut earlier, I found cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so Area = 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nBut now, using the formula involving the normal vector, I get 4\u03c0\u221a3.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. So, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the formula.\n\nI think the formula is:\n\nWhen slicing a cylinder with radius r along a plane, the area of the cross-section is (2\u03c0r\u00b2) / |n \u00b7 k|, where n is the unit normal vector of the plane.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the area is equal to the area of the base circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nBut in that case, 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, using the normal vector, the area is equal to (Area of base circle) / |n \u00b7 k|, where n is the unit normal vector.\n\nWait, n is (2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3). Its magnitude is sqrt( (2\u221a3)^2 + 6^2 + (3\u221a3)^2 ) = sqrt(12 + 36 + 27) = sqrt(75) = 5\u221a3.\n\nSo, the unit normal vector is (2\u221a3 / (5\u221a3), 6 / (5\u221a3), 3\u221a3 / (5\u221a3)) = (2/5, 6/(5\u221a3), 3/5).\n\nThen, n \u00b7 k = 3/5.\n\nSo, the area would be (Area of base circle) / |n \u00b7 k| = 36\u03c0 / (3/5) = 36\u03c0 * (5/3) = 60\u03c0.\n\nWait, now it's 60\u03c0.\n\nBut that contradicts my earlier result.\n\nI think I need to find a reliable formula.\n\nWait, according to some references, the area of the cross-section of a cylinder by a plane is equal to the area of the base circle divided by the cosine of the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nSo, if \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis, then Area = (\u03c0r\u00b2) / cos \u03b8.\n\nEarlier, I found cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so Area = 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, another formula says that the area is equal to (2\u03c0r\u00b2) / |n \u00b7 k|, but that seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because different sources define the angle differently.\n\nWait, let me instead compute the area using the parametrization.\n\nGiven the parametrization:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nWe can compute the area using the formula for the area of a parametric surface.\n\nWait, but this is a curve, not a surface.\n\nWait, but maybe I can use the formula for the area of a surface of revolution, but that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area by integrating the magnitude of the cross product of the tangent vectors.\n\nWait, yes, for a parametric curve, the area enclosed can be found by integrating (1/2)(x dy - y dx) over the parameter.\n\nWait, yes, Green's theorem can be applied here.\n\nSo, let's use Green's theorem to compute the area.\n\nGreen's theorem states that the area enclosed by a curve is (1/2) \u222b(x dy - y dx) over the curve.\n\nSo, let's compute \u222b(x dy - y dx) over \u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nGiven:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\ndx = -6 sin \u03b8 d\u03b8\ndy = 6 cos \u03b8 d\u03b8\n\nSo,\n\nx dy - y dx = (6 cos \u03b8)(6 cos \u03b8 d\u03b8) - (6 sin \u03b8)(-6 sin \u03b8 d\u03b8)\n= 36 cos\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8 + 36 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 d\u03b8\n= 36 (cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8) d\u03b8\n= 36 d\u03b8\n\nTherefore, the integral \u222b(x dy - y dx) from \u03b8=0 to \u03b8=2\u03c0 is \u222b36 d\u03b8 from 0 to 2\u03c0 = 36*(2\u03c0) = 72\u03c0\n\nTherefore, the area is (1/2)*72\u03c0 = 36\u03c0.\n\nWait, that's just the area of the base circle. That can't be right because the cross-section is an ellipse, which should have a different area.\n\nWait, but according to Green's theorem, if I parameterize the curve in the plane, I should get the area of the ellipse.\n\nBut in this case, I parameterized the curve in 3D, but when projected onto the plane, it's still a closed curve.\n\nWait, but in reality, the cross-section is an ellipse, so the area should be larger than the base circle.\n\nBut according to this calculation, it's 36\u03c0, which is the same as the base circle. That can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying Green's theorem because the curve is in 3D, not in 2D.\n\nWait, Green's theorem applies to planar curves. So, since the cross-section is in a tilted plane, I need to project it onto a 2D coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the area by scaling the result.\n\nWait, the area computed using Green's theorem is 36\u03c0, but that's in the 3D space. However, the ellipse is a 2D figure, so perhaps the area is scaled by the factor related to the angle.\n\nWait, earlier, I found that the cross-section area is 45\u03c0, which is 36\u03c0 / cos \u03b8, with cos \u03b8 = 4/5.\n\nSo, 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the area is 45\u03c0.\n\nBut again, the problem says it's a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which suggests that the area is a combination of a \u03c0 term and a radical term.\n\nSo, perhaps my entire approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is not an ellipse but a triangle or a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, no, slicing a cylinder with a plane that isn't parallel to the side or the base will result in an elliptical cross-section.\n\nWait, unless the plane is tangent, but in this case, it's passing through two points and the center, so it's a secant plane.\n\nSo, it's definitely an ellipse.\n\nWait, so why is the problem saying the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the cross-section is not a full ellipse but a portion of it.\n\nWait, but the plane slices through the entire cylinder, so the cross-section is a full ellipse.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering only half of the ellipse, but the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces\".\n\nEach half of the cylinder has an entire ellipse as its unpainted face.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the angle \u03b8.\n\nEarlier, I found cos \u03b8 = 4/5, but perhaps it's actually sin \u03b8 = 4/5.\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nThe angle between the plane and the axis is \u03b8.\n\nThe angle between the normal vector and the axis is \u03c6.\n\nSo, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - \u03c6.\n\nWe found cos \u03c6 = 3/5, so \u03c6 = arccos(3/5).\n\nTherefore, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - arccos(3/5) = arcsin(3/5).\n\nWait, no, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the angle between the normal and the axis.\n\nSo, cos \u03c6 = 3/5, so \u03c6 = arccos(3/5). Therefore, \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 - arccos(3/5).\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = sin(90\u00b0 - \u03c6) = cos \u03c6 = 3/5.\n\nWait, no, sin(90\u00b0 - \u03c6) = cos \u03c6, so sin \u03b8 = 3/5.\n\nWait, but \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis, so sin \u03b8 = 3/5.\n\nTherefore, cos \u03b8 = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2 \u03b8) = sqrt(1 - 9/25) = sqrt(16/25) = 4/5.\n\nTherefore, cos \u03b8 = 4/5, which is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the area is 36\u03c0 / (4/5) = 45\u03c0.\n\nSo, why does the problem say it's a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac?\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is not the entire ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says the block is sliced in half along the plane that passes through A, B, and the center, revealing a flat, unpainted face on each half.\n\nSo, each half has a flat, unpainted face, which is the cross-section.\n\nBut if the cross-section is an ellipse with area 45\u03c0, then why does the problem specify the area as a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac?\n\nWait, unless the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape whose area includes both \u03c0 and a radical term.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a combination of a sector and a triangle.\n\nWait, let me think again about the cross-section.\n\nWait, the plane passes through A, B, and the center.\n\nSo, in the base circle, the chord AB is 120 degrees, so the length is 6\u221a3, as I found before.\n\nIn the cylinder, the plane slices through the cylinder from A to B, passing through the center.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle with one side being the chord AB and the other side being the line from the center to the top of the cylinder.\n\nWait, but the center is at (0,0,4), so the line from the center to the top is 4 units.\n\nWait, so the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 4.\n\nTherefore, the area is 6\u221a3 * 4 = 24\u221a3.\n\nWait, but that's inconsistent with the previous results.\n\nWait, but if the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 4, then the area is 24\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=24, c=3. Then, a + b + c = 0 + 24 + 3 = 27.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the cross-section is an ellipse with area 45\u03c0, but this approach suggests it's a rectangle.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle because the plane passes through the center and two points on the base, so it slices the cylinder vertically.\n\nWait, but in that case, the cross-section should be a rectangle.\n\nWait, let me consider the cylinder as a stack of circles. If I slice it with a plane that goes through the center and two points on the base, the cross-section would be a rectangle.\n\nWait, but in reality, the cross-section of a cylinder with a plane that is not perpendicular to the axis and not parallel to the side is an ellipse, unless it's parallel or perpendicular.\n\nWait, but in this case, the plane is passing through the center, which is on the axis, and through two points on the base.\n\nWait, so the plane is not perpendicular to the axis, nor is it parallel to the side.\n\nWait, so the cross-section should be an ellipse.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought of it as a rectangle, but that's when the plane contains the axis, which is not the case here.\n\nWait, the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, but also through two points on the base. So, the plane is not containing the entire axis, just passing through one point on it.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is an ellipse.\n\nBut then, why does the area come out to 45\u03c0, which is purely a \u03c0 term?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a triangle.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a continuous curve, so it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to compute the area using another method.\n\nWait, let me compute the area using the parametrization.\n\nWe have the parametrization:\n\nx = 6 cos \u03b8\ny = 6 sin \u03b8\nz = 4 - 4 cos \u03b8 - 4\u221a3 sin \u03b8\n\nTo compute the area of the ellipse, I can use the formula for the area of a parametric surface, but it's a curve, so that's not applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps I can compute the area by finding the lengths of the major and minor axes.\n\nWait, the major axis is the diameter divided by cos \u03b8, which is 6 / (4/5) = 7.5, as before.\n\nThen, the minor axis remains 6.\n\nSo, the area is \u03c0 * 7.5 * 6 = 45\u03c0.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which is confusing.\n\nWait, unless the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, let me think about the nature of the cross-section.\n\nThe plane passes through A, B, and the center.\n\nSo, in the base circle, points A and B are separated by 120 degrees.\n\nSo, the chord AB is 6\u221a3.\n\nThe plane also passes through the center, so it's like slicing the cylinder with a knife that goes through A, B, and the center.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle with length AB = 6\u221a3 and height equal to the distance from the center to the top, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle with area 6\u221a3 * 4 = 24\u221a3.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was an ellipse, but this makes sense.\n\nWait, but if the cross-section is a rectangle, then the area is 24\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=24, c=3.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, so a=0 is allowed.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the Asymptote code shows a more complex shape.\n\nWait, looking back at the Asymptote code, it's drawing surfaces, but I can't visualize it perfectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle, but the problem is referring to the area of the face, which is a rectangle.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's a right circular cylinder, so slicing through A, B, and the center would create a flat face that's a rectangle.\n\nWait, so if the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 4, then the area is 24\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, a=0, b=24, c=3, so a + b + c = 0 + 24 + 3 = 27.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which would be 0\u00b7\u03c0 + 24\u221a3.\n\nBut is 24\u221a3 the correct area?\n\nWait, let me think again. If the cross-section is a rectangle, then yes.\n\nBut why did I initially think it was an ellipse?\n\nBecause when a plane slices a cylinder at an angle, it's usually an ellipse, but in this case, the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, so maybe it's a rectangle.\n\nWait, actually, when the plane passes through the axis, the cross-section is a rectangle.\n\nWait, in this case, the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, but not through the entire axis.\n\nWait, but the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, and through two points on the base.\n\nSo, the plane is not containing the entire axis, just passing through one point on it.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is not a rectangle but an ellipse.\n\nWait, so I'm confused again.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the cross-section as a parallelogram.\n\nThe plane slices the cylinder, creating a parallelogram.\n\nThe base of the parallelogram is the chord AB, which is 6\u221a3, and the height is the distance from the center to the top, which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the area is 6\u221a3 * 4 = 24\u221a3.\n\nBut in that case, the cross-section is a parallelogram, not an ellipse.\n\nWait, but a parallelogram is a type of ellipse? No, a parallelogram is a flat shape with four sides, while an ellipse is a smooth curve.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle if the plane is perpendicular to the axis, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, I think I need to resolve this confusion.\n\nWait, in the case where the plane contains the axis, the cross-section is a rectangle. In this problem, the plane does not contain the entire axis, just the center, which is a single point on the axis.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is an ellipse.\n\nTherefore, the area is 45\u03c0, which is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=45, b=0, c=0, but c=0 is not square-free.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a triangle.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section is a closed curve, so it's an ellipse.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the lateral surface area, but the problem says the area of the unpainted face, which is flat.\n\nTherefore, it's the area of the ellipse, which is 45\u03c0.\n\nBut then, why does the problem have the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac?\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is 45\u03c0, so a=45, b=0, c=0, but c=0 is not allowed. So, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is not an ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, let me try to compute the area using another method.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with sides AB and the height.\n\nAB is 6\u221a3, and the height is 8, so the area is 6\u221a3 * 8 = 48\u221a3.\n\nBut then, the area is 48\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=48, c=3, so a + b + c = 0 + 48 + 3 = 51.\n\nBut this contradicts the previous results.\n\nWait, but in reality, the height of the cylinder is 8, but the distance from the center to the top is 4.\n\nWait, perhaps the height along the plane is different.\n\nWait, the plane is tilted, so the height of the cross-section is not 8, but something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with sides AB = 6\u221a3 and the height along the plane.\n\nWait, but the height along the plane would be the distance from A to the top along the plane.\n\nWait, point A is at (6,0,0), and the top of the cylinder is at z=8.\n\nBut the plane passes through A, B, and the center.\n\nSo, the line from A to the top along the plane would be a line from (6,0,0) to (6,0,8), but that's not on the plane.\n\nWait, no, the plane equation is z = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3.\n\nSo, to find the point on the plane at z=8, we can set z=8 and solve for x and y.\n\n8 = 4 - (2x)/3 - (2y)/\u221a3\n\nSo,\n\n(2x)/3 + (2y)/\u221a3 = 4 - 8 = -4\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n2x + (6y)/\u221a3 = -12\n\nSimplify:\n\n2x + 2\u221a3 y = -12\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx + \u221a3 y = -6\n\nSo, the line of intersection at z=8 is x + \u221a3 y = -6.\n\nBut this line is outside the cylinder, since the cylinder at z=8 is the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nSo, the plane intersects the top face of the cylinder at points where x + \u221a3 y = -6 and x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nSolving these equations:\n\nFrom x + \u221a3 y = -6, we have x = -6 - \u221a3 y.\n\nSubstitute into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36:\n\n(-6 - \u221a3 y)^2 + y\u00b2 = 36\n\nExpand:\n\n(36 + 12\u221a3 y + 3 y\u00b2) + y\u00b2 = 36\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n36 + 12\u221a3 y + 4 y\u00b2 = 36\n\nSubtract 36:\n\n12\u221a3 y + 4 y\u00b2 = 0\n\nFactor:\n\n4 y (3\u221a3 + y) = 0\n\nSo, y = 0 or y = -3\u221a3\n\nIf y = 0, then x = -6 - \u221a3*0 = -6\n\nIf y = -3\u221a3, then x = -6 - \u221a3*(-3\u221a3) = -6 + 9 = 3\n\nTherefore, the plane intersects the top face at (-6, 0, 8) and (3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nSo, the cross-section is a quadrilateral with vertices at A (6,0,0), B (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), (-6, 0, 8), and (3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nWait, so the cross-section is actually a quadrilateral, not an ellipse.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a four-sided figure, a trapezoid or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, let's check the coordinates.\n\nPoint A: (6,0,0)\n\nPoint B: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nPoint C: (-6, 0, 8)\n\nPoint D: (3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nSo, connecting A to B to C to D to A.\n\nWait, is this a planar figure? Yes, because all points lie on the slicing plane.\n\nSo, the cross-section is a quadrilateral.\n\nNow, to compute its area, perhaps we can divide it into two triangles or use the shoelace formula.\n\nBut since it's in 3D, we need to project it onto a 2D plane.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the area using vectors.\n\nCompute vectors AB, AC, AD, etc., but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since it's a planar quadrilateral, we can compute its area by finding the magnitude of the cross product of its diagonals or something else.\n\nWait, another idea: The area of a planar polygon in 3D can be computed by projecting it onto a coordinate plane.\n\nFirst, find a coordinate system on the plane.\n\nAlternatively, compute the area using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) | (AB \u00d7 AD) + (BC \u00d7 BD) | or something like that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to compute the area by using the coordinates.\n\nLet me list the coordinates of the quadrilateral:\n\nA: (6,0,0)\n\nB: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nC: (-6, 0, 8)\n\nD: (3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nWait, connecting A to B to C to D to A.\n\nThis is a non-planar quadrilateral? Wait, no, all points lie on the slicing plane, so it's planar.\n\nTo compute the area, perhaps I can use the shoelace formula in 3D.\n\nBut the shoelace formula works in 2D. So, I need to project the quadrilateral onto a 2D plane.\n\nFirst, find a coordinate transformation that maps the 3D points to 2D.\n\nGiven the plane equation, we can define a local coordinate system on the plane.\n\nLet me define two orthonormal vectors on the plane.\n\nEarlier, we found:\n\nu1 = (3/\u221a13, 0, -2/\u221a13)\n\nu2 = (-4\u221a39/65, \u221a13/5, -6\u221a39/65 )\n\nThese are orthonormal vectors in the plane.\n\nNow, we can express each point in terms of these vectors.\n\nBut this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the area using the following formula for a planar polygon in 3D:\n\nArea = (1/2) |sum_{i=1 to n} (Pi \u00d7 Pi+1)|, where Pi are the position vectors relative to a point on the plane.\n\nBut this requires knowing the normal vector.\n\nWait, another formula: The area can be computed as (1/2) times the magnitude of the sum over edges of the cross products.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the following approach:\n\nGiven four points A, B, C, D in order, the area can be computed as the sum of the areas of triangles ABC and ACD.\n\nBut since the quadrilateral is planar, this should work.\n\nCompute the area of triangle ABC and the area of triangle ACD, then add them.\n\nCompute area of triangle ABC:\n\nPoints A (6,0,0), B (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), C (-6, 0, 8)\n\nVectors AB = B - A = (-9, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nVectors AC = C - A = (-12, 0, 8)\n\nCompute the cross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-9 3\u221a3 \u00a00|\n|-12 \u00a00 \u00a0\u00a08|\n\n= i*(3\u221a3*8 - 0*0) - j*(-9*8 - 0*(-12)) + k*(-9*0 - 3\u221a3*(-12))\n\n= i*(24\u221a3) - j*(-72) + k*(36\u221a3)\n\n= (24\u221a3, 72, 36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (24\u221a3)^2 + 72^2 + (36\u221a3)^2 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(24\u221a3)^2 = 576 * 3 = 1728\n\n72^2 = 5184\n\n(36\u221a3)^2 = 1296 * 3 = 3888\n\nTotal: 1728 + 5184 + 3888 = 10800\n\nsqrt(10800) = sqrt(100 * 108) = 10 * sqrt(108) = 10 * 6 * sqrt(3) = 60\u221a3\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*60\u221a3 = 30\u221a3\n\nSimilarly, compute the area of triangle ACD:\n\nPoints A (6,0,0), C (-6, 0, 8), D (3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nVectors AC = C - A = (-12, 0, 8)\n\nVectors AD = D - A = (-3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nCompute the cross product AC \u00d7 AD:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-12 \u00a00 \u00a0\u00a08|\n|-3 -3\u221a3 \u00a08|\n\n= i*(0*8 - 8*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-12*8 - 8*(-3)) + k*(-12*(-3\u221a3) - 0*(-3))\n\n= i*(24\u221a3) - j*(-96 + 24) + k*(36\u221a3 - 0)\n\n= (24\u221a3, 72, 36\u221a3)\n\nSame as before, magnitude is 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle ACD is (1/2)*60\u221a3 = 30\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the total area of the quadrilateral ABCD is 30\u221a3 + 30\u221a3 = 60\u221a3.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the area of the quadrilateral should be less than the lateral surface area.\n\nWait, but according to this calculation, the area is 60\u221a3, which is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3, so a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier results.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the cross product for triangle ABC, I got 60\u221a3, which seems too large.\n\nWait, let me verify the cross product calculation.\n\nFor triangle ABC:\n\nVectors AB = (-9, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nVectors AC = (-12, 0, 8)\n\nCross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\ni: (3\u221a3 * 8 - 0 * 0) = 24\u221a3\n\nj: - ( (-9 * 8 - 0 * (-12)) ) = - ( -72 ) = 72\n\nk: ( (-9 * 0 - 3\u221a3 * (-12)) ) = 0 + 36\u221a3 = 36\u221a3\n\nSo, cross product is (24\u221a3, 72, 36\u221a3)\n\nMagnitude squared: (24\u221a3)^2 + 72^2 + (36\u221a3)^2 = 1728 + 5184 + 3888 = 10800\n\nsqrt(10800) = 60\u221a3\n\nSo, magnitude is 60\u221a3, so area is 30\u221a3.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle ACD, cross product is same, so area is 30\u221a3.\n\nTotal area: 60\u221a3.\n\nBut this seems large. Let me check the coordinates again.\n\nPoint A: (6,0,0)\n\nPoint B: (-3, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nPoint C: (-6, 0, 8)\n\nPoint D: (3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nPlotting these points, they form a symmetric quadrilateral.\n\nBut 60\u221a3 seems too large for the area.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross product.\n\nWait, the cross product for triangle ABC is AB \u00d7 AC, but actually, for the area, it should be AB \u00d7 AC divided by 2.\n\nWait, no, the area is half the magnitude of the cross product.\n\nWait, yes, I did that: 60\u221a3 / 2 = 30\u221a3.\n\nSimilarly for the other triangle.\n\nTherefore, the total area is 60\u221a3.\n\nBut according to the problem, the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac.\n\nSo, 60\u221a3 is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\nSo, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct because I thought the cross-section was an ellipse with area 45\u03c0.\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, the cross-section is a quadrilateral with area 60\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac\".\n\nIf the cross-section is a quadrilateral, then the area is 60\u221a3, which is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a triangle, but according to the coordinates, it's a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is considering only half of the cross-section.\n\nBut the problem says \"the area of one of these unpainted faces\", and each half has an entire face.\n\nSo, if the cross-section is a quadrilateral with area 60\u221a3, then that's the area.\n\nBut according to the Asymptote code, the figure is more complex, but I can't visualize it perfectly.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is actually a triangle, but I have four points.\n\nWait, no, the plane slices through four points: A, B, C, D, forming a quadrilateral.\n\nTherefore, the area is 60\u221a3.\n\nBut the problem says the area is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac, which is possible with a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\nTherefore, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nBut in the problem, the answer is supposed to be between 0 and 999, so 63 is acceptable.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the cross-section was an ellipse with area 45\u03c0, which would be 45\u03c0 + 0\u221ac, but c=0 is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, if the cross-section is a rectangle, area 24\u221a3, which would be 0\u03c0 +24\u221a3, but again, c=3 is square-free.\n\nBut according to the coordinates, the cross-section is a quadrilateral with area 60\u221a3.\n\nWait, but when I computed the cross-section as a quadrilateral, I considered two triangles each with area 30\u221a3, so total 60\u221a3.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate system.\n\nWait, another idea: Since the plane is cutting through the cylinder, the cross-section is actually a rectangle with sides equal to the chord AB and the height.\n\nWait, chord AB is 6\u221a3, and the height is 8, so area is 6\u221a3 * 8 = 48\u221a3.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, but in reality, the height along the plane is not 8, because the plane is tilted.\n\nWait, so the height is not 8, but something else.\n\nWait, the height along the plane can be found by computing the distance between the two circular faces along the plane.\n\nBut that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle with sides 6\u221a3 and 4, giving area 24\u221a3.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a parallelogram with base 6\u221a3 and height 4, giving area 24\u221a3.\n\nBut according to the coordinate calculation, the area is 60\u221a3.\n\nI think I need to resolve this.\n\nWait, let me consider the plane slicing the cylinder.\n\nThe cross-section is a rectangle if the plane is perpendicular to the axis, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, but the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, so perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle.\n\nWait, but the plane also passes through two points on the base, which are not on the axis.\n\nWait, so the cross-section is a rectangle with one side being the chord AB and the other side being the line from the center to the top.\n\nWait, but the line from the center to the top is perpendicular to the base, so in this case, it's vertical.\n\nBut the chord AB is horizontal.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle with sides AB = 6\u221a3 and height 4.\n\nTherefore, the area is 6\u221a3 * 4 = 24\u221a3.\n\nBut according to the coordinate calculation, it's 60\u221a3.\n\nSo, there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle, but the height is not 4.\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, the center is at (0,0,4), so the distance from the center to the top is 4.\n\nTherefore, the height of the rectangle is 4, and the base is AB = 6\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area is 24\u221a3.\n\nBut according to the coordinate calculation, it's 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle, but in reality, the plane is cutting through the cylinder at an angle, so the cross-section is actually a parallelogram with sides AB and the height along the plane.\n\nBut in that case, the area is base times height, where base is AB = 6\u221a3, and height is the distance from the line AB to the opposite line on the top face.\n\nWait, the height would be the perpendicular distance between the lines AB and CD on the top face.\n\nBut AB is on the base, CD is on the top.\n\nWait, the distance between AB and CD is the height of the cylinder, which is 8, but projected along the plane.\n\nWait, but the plane is tilted, so the height along the plane is longer.\n\nWait, the height along the plane can be found by dividing the actual height by cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the plane and the axis.\n\nEarlier, we found cos \u03b8 = 4/5, so the height along the plane is 8 / (4/5) = 10.\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is base times height along the plane: 6\u221a3 * 10 = 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area is 60\u221a3.\n\nBut that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, but if the cross-section is a parallelogram with base AB = 6\u221a3 and height along the plane = 10, then the area is 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area is 60\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\nTherefore, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the Asymptote code shows a more complex shape, but I can't be sure.\n\nWait, but according to the coordinate calculation, the area is 60\u221a3, which is a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 63.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 45\u03c0, which is also a possible answer, but with a different form.\n\nBut according to the calculation of the quadrilateral, it's 60\u221a3.\n\nI think I need to decide which approach is correct.\n\nThe key is whether the cross-section is a quadrilateral or an ellipse.\n\nWait, in reality, slicing a cylinder with a plane results in an ellipse unless the plane is parallel to a side or passes through the axis.\n\nIn this case, the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, but not through the entire axis.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section should be an ellipse.\n\nBut according to the coordinate calculation, the cross-section is a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, that suggests that the cross-section is actually a rectangle, but the calculation shows a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-section is a rectangle when the plane is perpendicular to the axis, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is arising because the plane passes through the center, which is on the axis, but not through the entire axis.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle.\n\nWait, but according to the coordinate calculation, it's a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find another way.\n\nWait, the cross-section is a rectangle if the plane is perpendicular to the axis, but in this case, it's not.\n\nWait, but the plane passes through the center and two points on the base.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a rectangle.\n\nWait, but according to the coordinates, it's a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the points.\n\nWait, the plane intersects the top face at (-6,0,8) and (3, -3\u221a3,8).\n\nSo, the cross-section is a quadrilateral with vertices at (6,0,0), (-3, 3\u221a3,0), (-6,0,8), (3, -3\u221a3,8).\n\nThis is a trapezoid.\n\nWait, a trapezoid has two sides parallel.\n\nCheck if any sides are parallel.\n\nCompute vectors:\n\nAB: from A (6,0,0) to B (-3, 3\u221a3,0): (-9, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nCD: from C (-6,0,8) to D (3, -3\u221a3,8): (9, -3\u221a3, 0)\n\nSo, AB and CD are negatives of each other, meaning they are parallel and equal in magnitude.\n\nSimilarly, BC: from B (-3, 3\u221a3,0) to C (-6,0,8): (-3, -3\u221a3,8)\n\nAD: from A (6,0,0) to D (3, -3\u221a3,8): (-3, -3\u221a3,8)\n\nSo, BC and AD are equal vectors, meaning they are parallel and equal in magnitude.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is a parallelogram.\n\nTherefore, the area can be computed as the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AD.\n\nVectors AB = (-9, 3\u221a3, 0)\n\nVectors AD = (-3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nCompute cross product AB \u00d7 AD:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-9 3\u221a3 \u00a00|\n|-3 -3\u221a3 \u00a08|\n\n= i*(3\u221a3*8 - 0*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-9*8 - 0*(-3)) + k*(-9*(-3\u221a3) - 3\u221a3*(-3))\n\n= i*(24\u221a3) - j*(-72) + k*(27\u221a3 + 9\u221a3)\n\n= (24\u221a3, 72, 36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (24\u221a3)^2 + 72^2 + (36\u221a3)^2 )\n\n= sqrt( 1728 + 5184 + 3888 )\n\n= sqrt(10800) = 60\u221a3\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is 60\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the area of the unpainted face is 60\u221a3, which is in the form a\u00b7\u03c0 + b\u221ac with a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\nThus, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 63.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{63}\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a right circular cylinder with radius 6 and height 8, where the entire surface is painted blue. Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are on the edge of one of the circular faces, and the arc \\(\\overarc{AB}\\) measures \\(120^\\circ\\). The block is sliced along the plane passing through \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and the center of the cylinder, revealing an unpainted face on each half.\n\nTo solve this, we need to determine the area of the unpainted face. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Understanding the Cross-Section**: The plane passes through points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and the center of the cylinder, resulting in a flat, unpainted face. This cross-section is a parallelogram because the plane intersects the cylinder at an angle.\n\n2. **Coordinates of Points**: Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are on the circular face with radius 6. The coordinates of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are \\((6, 0, 0)\\) and \\((-3, 3\\sqrt{3}, 0)\\) respectively. The center of the cylinder is at \\((0, 0, 4)\\).\n\n3. **Vectors and Cross Product**: We calculate the vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{AD} \\) to find the cross product, which helps determine the area of the parallelogram. The vectors are:\n   - \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} = (-9, 3\\sqrt{3}, 0) \\)\n   - \\( \\overrightarrow{AD} = (-3, -3\\sqrt{3}, 8) \\)\n\n4. **Cross Product Calculation**: The cross product of vectors \\( \\overrightarrow{AB} \\) and \\( \\overrightarrow{AD} \\) is computed as:\n   \\[\n   \\overrightarrow{AB} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n   \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n   -9 & 3\\sqrt{3} & 0 \\\\\n   -3 & -3\\sqrt{3} & 8\n   \\end{vmatrix} = (24\\sqrt{3}, 72, 36\\sqrt{3})\n   \\]\n\n5. **Magnitude of Cross Product**: The magnitude of the cross product vector is:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{(24\\sqrt{3})^2 + 72^2 + (36\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{10800} = 60\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Area of Parallelogram**: The area of the parallelogram is half the magnitude of the cross product:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 60\\sqrt{3} = 30\\sqrt{3}\n   \\]\n\nHowever, considering the entire cross-section, the area is actually the magnitude of the cross product, which is \\(60\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\n7. **Form of the Area**: The area is given as \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\). Here, \\(a = 0\\), \\(b = 60\\), and \\(c = 3\\). Thus, \\(a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{63}\n\\]",

      "summary": "The attempted solution delves deeply into the geometry of the problem, correctly identifying that the slicing plane through the cylinder creates an unpainted face on each half that is a parallelogram. Here's a summarized version of the key points:\n\n1. **Identification of Points and Geometry**: The problem involves a right circular cylinder with radius 6 and height 8, painted entirely blue. Points A and B are on the circular base, with arc AB measuring 120 degrees. The plane slicing through the cylinder passes through A, B, and the center, revealing an unpainted face on each half.\n\n2. **Calculation of Chord Length**: The chord AB was correctly calculated as 6\u221a3 using the formula for chord length in a circle.\n\n3. **Equation of the Plane**: The equation of the slicing plane was derived as 4x - 3z = -12, which intersects the cylinder, creating an elliptical cross-section.\n\n4. **Cross-Section Analysis**: Initially, the solution considered the cross-section as an ellipse but realized the problem's statement about the area form (a\u03c0 + b\u221ac) suggested a different approach. It then correctly identified that the slicing plane intersects the top and bottom faces of the cylinder, creating a parallelogram on each half.\n\n5. **Area Calculation**: The area of the parallelogram was computed using vectors AB and AA', resulting in an area of 60\u221a3. This fits the form a\u03c0 + b\u221ac, where a=0, b=60, and c=3.\n\n6. **Final Answer**: The solution concludes that the area is 60\u221a3, fitting the form 0\u03c0 + 60\u221a3, leading to a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nThe solution demonstrates a thorough understanding of the geometric properties and calculations involved, leading to the correct identification of the shape and area of the unpainted face, which matches the problem's requirements.",

      "improved_reasoning": "Okay, so I have this AIME problem about a cylinder that's been painted blue. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 8. Points A and B are on the edge of one of the circular faces, and the arc between them measures 120 degrees. Then, the block is sliced in half along a plane that passes through points A, B, and the center of the cylinder. This slicing reveals a flat, unpainted face on each half, and I need to find the area of one of these unpainted faces. The area is given in the form \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\), and I need to find \\(a + b + c\\).\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the cylinder. It's a right circular cylinder, so the bases are circles with radius 6, and the height is 8. Points A and B are on the edge of one of these circular faces, and the arc between them is 120 degrees. Since the circumference of the circle is \\(2\\pi r = 12\\pi\\), a 120-degree arc would be \\(\\frac{120}{360} \\times 12\\pi = 4\\pi\\). But maybe more importantly, the chord length between A and B can be calculated.\n\nThe chord length formula is \\(2r \\sin(\\theta/2)\\), where \\(\\theta\\) is the central angle. So, for a 120-degree angle, the chord length is \\(2 \\times 6 \\times \\sin(60^\\circ) = 12 \\times (\\sqrt{3}/2) = 6\\sqrt{3}\\). That seems right.\n\nNow, the plane slices through A, B, and the center of the cylinder. Let me think about what this plane does. Since it passes through the center, it's not just a slice near the surface but goes all the way through the cylinder. The intersection of this plane with the cylinder will create an ellipse on the surface, but since we're slicing through the center, maybe the shape is different.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the slicing reveals a flat, unpainted face on each half. So, the unpainted face is the cross-section of the plane cutting through the cylinder. The area of this cross-section is what I need to find.\n\nI think the cross-section is a parallelogram. Let me try to figure that out. If I slice the cylinder with a plane that goes through two points on the base and the center, the intersection should be a parallelogram because it's cutting through the circular bases and the sides.\n\nBut how do I calculate the area of this parallelogram? I remember that the area of a parallelogram is base times height. The base could be the chord AB, which is \\(6\\sqrt{3}\\). The height would be the distance from the center of the cylinder to the plane, but wait, the plane passes through the center, so the height might be related to the height of the cylinder.\n\nWait, no, the height of the parallelogram isn't the height of the cylinder. Instead, it's the distance between the two parallel sides of the parallelogram. Since the plane passes through the center, maybe the height is the same as the height of the cylinder? No, that doesn't seem right because the plane is slicing at an angle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the vectors involved. If I can find two vectors that define the parallelogram, I can take their cross product to find the area.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Let's put the center of the circular face on the xy-plane, with the center at the origin (0,0,0). The height of the cylinder goes along the z-axis, so the top face is at z=8.\n\nPoint A is on the circular face, and the arc from A to B is 120 degrees. Let's place point A at (6, 0, 0). Then, moving 120 degrees around the circle, point B would be at (6 cos 120\u00b0, 6 sin 120\u00b0, 0). Calculating that, cos 120\u00b0 is -1/2, and sin 120\u00b0 is \\(\\sqrt{3}/2\\). So, point B is at (6*(-1/2), 6*(\\sqrt{3}/2), 0) = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nNow, the plane passes through points A, B, and the center of the cylinder (0,0,0). So, these three points define the plane. Let me find the equation of this plane.\n\nTo find the equation of the plane, I can use the three points: A(6,0,0), B(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and O(0,0,0). Let's find two vectors in the plane: vector OA = (6,0,0) and vector OB = (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). The normal vector to the plane is the cross product of OA and OB.\n\nCalculating the cross product:\n\nOA \u00d7 OB = |i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a00\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-3 3\u221a3 \u00a00\n\n= i*(0*0 - 0*3\u221a3) - j*(6*0 - 0*(-3)) + k*(6*3\u221a3 - 0*(-3))\n= i*(0) - j*(0) + k*(18\u221a3)\n= (0, 0, 18\u221a3)\n\nSo the normal vector is (0, 0, 18\u221a3), which simplifies to (0, 0, 1) when normalized. Therefore, the plane equation is z = 0? Wait, that can't be right because points A, B, and O are all on the z=0 plane, but the plane slices through the cylinder, which has height along the z-axis. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, points A and B are on the base at z=0, and the center is also at z=0. So, the plane passing through A, B, and the center is the same as the base, which is z=0. But that doesn't make sense because slicing along z=0 wouldn't reveal any new face\u2014it's already the base. So, I must have messed up something.\n\nWait a second, no. The center of the cylinder is at (0,0,4), right? Because the height is 8, so the center is halfway along the z-axis. So, actually, the center is at (0,0,4), not (0,0,0). That was my mistake. So, let's correct that.\n\nLet me redefine the coordinate system. Let's place the center of the cylinder at (0,0,4). So, the bottom face is at z=0, and the top face is at z=8. Then, point A is on the bottom face at (6,0,0), and point B is on the bottom face at (-3, 3\u221a3, 0). The center is at (0,0,4).\n\nSo, now, the plane passes through A(6,0,0), B(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), and the center C(0,0,4). Now, let's find the equation of this plane.\n\nFirst, let's find two vectors in the plane. Vector AC is from A to C: (0-6, 0-0, 4-0) = (-6, 0, 4). Vector BC is from B to C: (0 - (-3), 0 - 3\u221a3, 4 - 0) = (3, -3\u221a3, 4).\n\nNow, the normal vector to the plane is the cross product of AC and BC.\n\nCalculating AC \u00d7 BC:\n\nAC = (-6, 0, 4)\nBC = (3, -3\u221a3, 4)\n\nCross product:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-6 \u00a0\u00a00 \u00a0\u00a04|\n|3 \u00a0-3\u221a3 \u00a04|\n\n= i*(0*4 - 4*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-6*4 - 4*3) + k*(-6*(-3\u221a3) - 0*3)\n= i*(0 + 12\u221a3) - j*(-24 - 12) + k*(18\u221a3 - 0)\n= (12\u221a3)i - (-36)j + (18\u221a3)k\n= (12\u221a3, 36, 18\u221a3)\n\nSo, the normal vector is (12\u221a3, 36, 18\u221a3). We can simplify this by dividing by 6: (2\u221a3, 6, 3\u221a3). So, the plane equation is 2\u221a3(x - 6) + 6(y - 0) + 3\u221a3(z - 0) = 0. Wait, no, that's not the right way to write the plane equation.\n\nActually, the general plane equation is A(x - x0) + B(y - y0) + C(z - z0) = 0, where (A,B,C) is the normal vector and (x0,y0,z0) is a point on the plane. Let's use point A(6,0,0):\n\n12\u221a3(x - 6) + 36(y - 0) + 18\u221a3(z - 0) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n12\u221a3 x - 72\u221a3 + 36y + 18\u221a3 z = 0\n\nDivide all terms by 6 to simplify:\n\n2\u221a3 x - 12\u221a3 + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 0\n\nBring constants to the other side:\n\n2\u221a3 x + 6y + 3\u221a3 z = 12\u221a3\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by \u221a3 to make it simpler:\n\n2x + (6/\u221a3)y + 3z = 12\n\nSimplify 6/\u221a3 to 2\u221a3:\n\n2x + 2\u221a3 y + 3z = 12\n\nSo, the plane equation is 2x + 2\u221a3 y + 3z = 12.\n\nNow, I need to find the intersection of this plane with the cylinder. The cylinder is defined by the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 6\u00b2 = 36, since it's a right circular cylinder with radius 6.\n\nTo find the intersection curve, we can parametrize the cylinder and substitute into the plane equation.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the method of finding the cross-section. Since the plane is cutting through the cylinder, the cross-section should be an ellipse, but since the plane passes through the center, it might actually be a rectangle or a parallelogram.\n\nWait, no, the cross-section of a cylinder with a plane is generally an ellipse, unless the plane is parallel to the side, in which case it's a rectangle. But in this case, the plane is passing through two points on the base and the center, so it's not parallel to the side. Therefore, the cross-section should be an ellipse.\n\nBut the problem says that the slicing reveals a flat, unpainted face on each half. So, each half has a new face, which is the cross-section. The area of this face is the area of the ellipse. But the problem states the area is \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\), which suggests it might not be a standard ellipse area.\n\nWait, actually, the cross-section when slicing a cylinder with a plane is an ellipse, whose area can be calculated as \u03c0ab, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. But the problem's answer is given in the form \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\), which is different. So maybe the cross-section isn't an ellipse but a different shape.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing something. When you slice a cylinder with a plane, the cross-section is an ellipse unless the plane is parallel to the side, in which case it's a rectangle, or if the plane is tangent, in which case it's a line. But in this case, the plane passes through two points on the base and the center, so it's definitely not tangent, and it's not parallel to the side because it's passing through points on the base.\n\nTherefore, the cross-section is an ellipse, but the area of the ellipse is \u03c0ab. However, the problem says the area is \\(a\\pi + b\\sqrt{c}\\), which is a combination of a multiple of \u03c0 and a square root term. That suggests that maybe the cross-section isn't an ellipse but another shape.\n\nWait, maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe the cross-section is a parallelogram because the plane is cutting through the top and bottom faces as well. Let me think.\n\nIf the plane passes through points A and B on the bottom face and the center, which is on the axis, then it also passes through the top face. So, the plane will intersect the top face at some points as well. Thus, the cross-section on each half will be a quadrilateral, perhaps a parallelogram.\n\nTo find the area, I need to find the shape of this cross-section. Let me try to find the intersection points of the plane with the top face of the cylinder.\n\nThe top face is at z=8. Let's plug z=8 into the plane equation:\n\n2x + 2\u221a3 y + 3*8 = 12\n2x + 2\u221a3 y + 24 = 12\n2x + 2\u221a3 y = -12\nDivide by 2:\nx + \u221a3 y = -6\n\nSo, on the top face at z=8, the intersection line is x + \u221a3 y = -6. But the top face is also a circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36.\n\nSo, we can solve for x from the plane equation: x = -6 - \u221a3 y.\n\nSubstitute into the top face equation:\n\n(-6 - \u221a3 y)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 36\n(36 + 12\u221a3 y + 3y\u00b2) + y\u00b2 = 36\n36 + 12\u221a3 y + 4y\u00b2 = 36\n12\u221a3 y + 4y\u00b2 = 0\nFactor out y:\ny(12\u221a3 + 4y) = 0\n\nSo, y = 0 or 12\u221a3 + 4y = 0 => y = -3\u221a3.\n\nTherefore, the intersection points on the top face are when y=0: x = -6 - 0 = -6, so point D is (-6, 0, 8). And when y = -3\u221a3: x = -6 - \u221a3*(-3\u221a3) = -6 + 9 = 3, so point E is (3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nSo, on the top face, the plane intersects at points D(-6, 0, 8) and E(3, -3\u221a3, 8).\n\nSimilarly, on the bottom face, the plane intersects at points A(6,0,0) and B(-3, 3\u221a3, 0).\n\nTherefore, the cross-section on the bottom half is a quadrilateral with vertices A(6,0,0), B(-3, 3\u221a3, 0), E(3, -3\u221a3, 8), and D(-6, 0, 8). Wait, that doesn't seem right because connecting A to B to E to D would make a four-sided figure, but I need to check the connections.\n\nWait, actually, the slicing plane passes through A, B, and the center, so on the bottom, it's the line AB, and on the top, it's the line DE. Since the plane is straight, the cross-section on each half is a quadrilateral, specifically a parallelogram because the sides are parallel.\n\nWait, let me check if the sides are parallel. The vector from A to B is B - A = (-3 - 6, 3\u221a3 - 0, 0 - 0) = (-9, 3\u221a3, 0). The vector from D to E is E - D = (3 - (-6), -3\u221a3 - 0, 8 - 8) = (9, -3\u221a3, 0). So, these vectors are negatives of each other, meaning they are parallel but in opposite directions. Similarly, the vector from B to E is E - B = (3 - (-3), -3\u221a3 - 3\u221a3, 8 - 0) = (6, -6\u221a3, 8). The vector from A to D is D - A = (-6 - 6, 0 - 0, 8 - 0) = (-12, 0, 8). Wait, these don't seem parallel. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a parallelogram because the sides AB and DE are parallel, and sides AE and BD are parallel. Let me check.\n\nWait, point A is (6,0,0), point E is (3, -3\u221a3, 8). So, vector AE is (-3, -3\u221a3, 8). Point B is (-3, 3\u221a3, 0), point D is (-6, 0, 8). Vector BD is (-3, -3\u221a3, 8). So, vectors AE and BD are equal, meaning sides AE and BD are equal and parallel. Similarly, vectors AB and ED: AB is (-9, 3\u221a3, 0), ED is (3 - (-6), -3\u221a3 - 0, 8 - 8) = (9, -3\u221a3, 0). So, AB and ED are negatives, meaning they are parallel but opposite in direction. So, yes, the cross-section is a parallelogram with sides AB and AE, which are vectors.\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram can be found by the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AE.\n\nLet me compute vectors AB and AE.\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-3 - 6, 3\u221a3 - 0, 0 - 0) = (-9, 3\u221a3, 0)\nVector AE = E - A = (3 - 6, -3\u221a3 - 0, 8 - 0) = (-3, -3\u221a3, 8)\n\nNow, the cross product AB \u00d7 AE is:\n\n|i \u00a0\u00a0j \u00a0\u00a0k|\n|-9 \u00a03\u221a3 \u00a00|\n|-3 -3\u221a3 \u00a08|\n\n= i*(3\u221a3*8 - 0*(-3\u221a3)) - j*(-9*8 - 0*(-3)) + k*(-9*(-3\u221a3) - 3\u221a3*(-3))\n= i*(24\u221a3 - 0) - j*(-72 - 0) + k*(27\u221a3 + 9\u221a3)\n= (24\u221a3)i - (-72)j + (36\u221a3)k\n= (24\u221a3, 72, 36\u221a3)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is:\n\n\u221a[(24\u221a3)^2 + 72^2 + (36\u221a3)^2]\n= \u221a[(24^2 * 3) + 72^2 + (36^2 * 3)]\n= \u221a[(576 * 3) + 5184 + (1296 * 3)]\n= \u221a[1728 + 5184 + 3888]\n= \u221a[1728 + 5184 = 6912; 6912 + 3888 = 10800]\n= \u221a10800\n= \u221a(100 * 108)\n= 10\u221a108\n= 10\u221a(36*3)\n= 10*6\u221a3\n= 60\u221a3\n\nSo, the area of the parallelogram is 60\u221a3. Therefore, the area is 0\u03c0 + 60\u221a3, so a=0, b=60, c=3. Thus, a + b + c = 0 + 60 + 3 = 63.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says the area is a\u03c0 + b\u221ac. In my calculation, I got 60\u221a3, which is just the b\u221ac term. So, a is 0. Is that acceptable? The problem says a, b, c are integers, and c is square-free, which it is (3 is prime). So, 60\u221a3 is in the correct form with a=0, b=60, c=3. So, the answer is 63.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the cross-section is a parallelogram, and the area is 60\u221a3. I thought initially it might be an ellipse, but since the cross-section is a parallelogram, the area calculation makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the area of the parallelogram is base times height. The base is AB, which is 6\u221a3, and the height is the distance from the plane to the opposite side. Wait, no, that's not straightforward because the height isn't just along the z-axis. Instead, the height in the parallelogram is the component of the vector AE perpendicular to AB.\n\nBut since we already calculated the cross product, which gives the area directly, that's the more straightforward method.\n\nSo, I think my final answer is 63, corresponding to a=0, b=60, c=3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{63}\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a right circular cylinder with radius 6 and height 8, which has been entirely painted blue. Points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are on the edge of one of the circular faces, with \\(\\overarc{AB}\\) measuring \\(120^\\circ\\).
