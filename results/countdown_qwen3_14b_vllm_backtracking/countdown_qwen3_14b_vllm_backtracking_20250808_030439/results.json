Alright, let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, I notice that 96 and 72 are both large numbers. Maybe subtracting them could help? Let me check. 96 - 72 is 24. Then I have 49 and 1 left. Hmm, 24 plus something? If I add 1, that's 25, then 49... not sure. Alternatively, maybe 96 divided by something? Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe find a way to get down to 36. Let's think of factors of 36. For example, 36 is 4*9, 6*6, 12*3, etc. Let me see if I can make any of these combinations.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 49 is a square number (7\u00b2), but not sure if that helps. Let's see. What if I subtract 49 - something? Let's try that. Suppose I do 49 - 1 = 48. Then maybe 96 and 72. If I take 96 - 72 = 24. Then 48 - 24 = 24. Not 36. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 divided by something. 72 divided by 2 is 36. Wait, how can I get 2 from the other numbers? Let's see. If I can make 2 from 49, 1, and 96. Let me think. For example, 96 divided by 48 is 2. But how to get 48? 49 -1 is 48. Oh! So here's an idea: 72 divided by ( (49 - 1) / 96 ) ? Wait, let me check that. Wait, 72 divided by ( (49 -1)/96 ) would be 72 * (96 / 48) = 72 * 2 = 144. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe if I do (something) divided by something else. Let me think again. Let's think of 72 - something equals 36. Then that something would be 36. So 72 - 36 = 36. How can I get 36 from 49, 1, 96? Let me see. Maybe 96 - 49 -1 = 46. No. 96 - (49 +1) = 46. Still not 36. Alternatively, 49 - (something) = 36. 49 - 13 = 36. How to get 13 from 96 and 1? 96 divided by something? 96 / 7.38... Not helpful. Maybe 96 - 1 = 95. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe combining 49 and 1 first. 49 +1 = 50. Then 96 and 72. Let's see, 96 - 72 = 24. Then 50 - 24 = 26. Not helpful. Or 96 / 72 = 1.333... Not helpful. 50 - (96 / 72) = 50 - 1.333... = 48.666... Not 36.\n\nWhat if I do 49 - (something) = 36. Then that something is 13. How to get 13 from 1, 96, 72? Let's see. 96 - 72 = 24. 24 - 1 = 23. No. 96 / something. 96 divided by 7.38... Not helpful. Maybe 72 divided by something. 72 / 5.538... No. Not helpful. Maybe 1 + something? 1 + (96 - 72) = 1 +24=25. Not 13. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe using multiplication and division. Let's think of fractions. For example, if I can do something like (96 / (something)) * (something else). Let's try. Suppose I take 96 divided by 49. That's roughly 1.959. Not helpful. How about 72 divided by something. 72 divided by 2 is 36. So if I can get 2 from 49, 1, and 96. Let me think. How to make 2 from 49, 1, 96? Maybe (96 - 49) - 1 = 46. No. Or (49 - 1) / 24? Wait, 49 -1 is 48. If I can divide that by 24, that would be 2. But how to get 24 from 96? Well, 96 divided by 4 is 24. But how to get 4? Not sure. Wait, but maybe I can do ( (49 - 1) / (96 / something) )? Let me think. Let's try to structure this.\n\nIf I want 72 divided by [something] equals 36. Then that something is 2. So 72 / 2 = 36. So how to get 2 from 49, 1, 96. Let's see. 96 divided by 48 is 2. How to get 48? 49 -1 = 48. Yes! So that would be 72 divided by (96 / (49 - 1)) = 72 / (96 / 48) = 72 / 2 = 36. So that uses 72, 96, 49, and 1. All numbers! Let me check:\n\nNumbers used: 72, 96, 49, 1. Yes. Each once. The operations are division and subtraction. So the equation would be 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) = 36. Let me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, 49 - 1 = 48. Then 96 divided by 48 is 2. Then 72 divided by 2 is 36. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the equation is 72 divided by (96 divided by (49 minus 1)). Which can be written as 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)).\n\nAlternatively, using parentheses properly: 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)).\n\nLet me check if that's the correct order. Yes, because division is left to right, but with parentheses, the denominator is calculated first. So yes.\n\nSo that uses all numbers once. Perfect. Therefore, the answer is that equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) </answer>",

The previous attempt was (72 / (96 / (49 - 1))). Let me check if that works.\n\nFirst, calculate the innermost parentheses: 49 - 1 = 48. Then, 96 divided by 48 is 2. Then, 72 divided by 2 is 36. Oh, that actually works! So the answer is correct. But the user wants me to think step by step and show my reasoning. Let me go through it again carefully.\n\nStep 1: Use all numbers once. The equation uses 72, 96, 49, and 1. Check.\n\nStep 2: Operations allowed are +, -, *, /. The equation uses division and subtraction. Check.\n\nStep 3: Parentheses are used correctly to control order. The innermost is (49 - 1), then (96 / that result), then (72 / that result). Check.\n\nStep 4: Result is 36. As calculated, 49 - 1 = 48, 96 / 48 = 2, 72 / 2 = 36. Check.\n\nSo the answer is correct. But the user might want to see if there's another way, or if there's any mistake. Let me think of another approach just to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe combining numbers differently. For example, 96 - 72 = 24. Then 49 - 1 = 48. 24 and 48... Not sure. 24 * something? 24 * (something) = 36? That would be 1.5. Not sure.\n\nOr 72 - 96 = -24. Then 49 - 1 = 48. -24 + 48 = 24. Not 36.\n\nAnother way: 49 - 1 = 48. 96 / 48 = 2. 72 / 2 = 36. That's the same as the previous answer.\n\nSo it seems that the given answer is correct and there's no other obvious way.

The numbers are 49, 1, 96, and 72. Let's think about combinations:\n\n- 96 and 72 are both multiples of 24. 96 is 4*24 and 72 is 3*24.\n- 49 is 7 squared.\n- 1 is a neutral number in multiplication and addition.\n\nMaybe we can use division or subtraction to reduce some of the larger numbers. Let's try combining 96 and 49 first. 96 - 49 = 47. That doesn't seem helpful.\n\nWhat about 49 - 1 = 48? That's interesting because 96 / 48 = 2, and 72 / 2 = 36.

Then 72 divided by 2 is 36. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the equation is 72 divided by (96 divided by (49 minus 1)). Which can be written as 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)).\n\nAlternatively, using parentheses properly: 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)).\n\nLet me check if that's the correct order. Yes, because division is left to right, but with parentheses, the denominator is calculated first. So yes.\n\nSo that uses all numbers once. Perfect. Therefore, the answer is that equation.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) </answer>",

I need to create an equation using the numbers 49, 1, 96, and 72 exactly once each, and the operations +, -, *, /, with parentheses as needed, to make the result equal to 36.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the numbers. 49 and 1 can be combined in some way. Maybe 49 - 1 = 48. Then, 96 divided by 48 is 2. Then 72 divided by 2 is 36. Oh, that works!\n\nSo the equation would be 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) = 36. Let me double-check that:\n\n49 - 1 = 48\n96 / 48 = 2\n72 / 2 = 36\n\nYes, that's correct. All numbers are used once, and the operations are valid.
