Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for ways to combine some numbers to get closer to 36. Let me list the numbers again: 49, 1, 96, 72. All have to be used once. Let me think about possible operations.\n\nSince 96 and 72 are both large numbers, maybe subtracting them could help? Let me try 96 - 72. That gives 24. Then I have 49 and 1 left. How can I combine 24 with 49 and 1? Maybe 49 - (something) equals 36? Wait, if I have 24, maybe adding something? Let me think. If I take 24 + 1 = 25, then 49 - 25 is 24. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 49 - 1 is 48. Then 48 - something? But I already used 96 and 72. Wait, no, I have to use all numbers. So maybe that approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about division. Maybe dividing some numbers. For example, 96 divided by something. Let me try 96 divided by (something) to get a useful number. If I take 96 divided by 49, that's not helpful. How about 72 divided by something? Let me think. If I can get 72 divided by something to get a number that can combine with others.\n\nWait, maybe combining 49 and 1 first. 49 - 1 is 48. Then maybe 96 - 72 is 24. Then 48 - 24 is 24. Not 36. Hmm. Alternatively, 49 + 1 is 50. Then 96 - 72 is 24. 50 - 24 is 26. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I multiply some numbers? Let's see. 1 is a tricky number because multiplying by 1 doesn't change anything. Maybe using division with 1. For example, 96 divided by something. Let me think. Suppose I do 96 divided by (something) equals a number that can be combined with others.\n\nAlternatively, think of 36 as a target. Let me think of factors of 36. For example, 36 can be 9*4, 12*3, 6*6, etc. Maybe I can create such factors using the numbers given.\n\nLooking at the numbers, maybe 72 divided by something? 72 divided by 2 is 36. But how to get 2 from the other numbers? Let's see. The other numbers are 49, 1, 96. Wait, if I can make 2 from 49, 1, and 96. Let me think. For example, 96 - 49 - 1 = 46. Not helpful. Or 49 - (96 / something). Wait, maybe 96 divided by (something) equals 48? Then 72 divided by (something) equals 36. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, if I take 72 divided by (something) equals 36. Then that something would be 2. So 72 / 2 = 36. How can I get 2 from 49, 1, and 96? Let me see. For example, (96 - 49 - 1) = 46. No. Or 96 - (49 + 1) = 46. Still not 2. How about (49 - 1) divided by something? 48 divided by 24 is 2. But how to get 24 from 96? 96 divided by 4 is 24. But then I need to use 4. Wait, but I don't have a 4. Alternatively, maybe 96 divided by (something) equals 24. Let me think. If I have 96 divided by (something) equals 24, then that something is 4. How to get 4 from 49, 1, and maybe others? Wait, maybe 49 - (something). Let me think. 49 - (something) = 4. That would require something to be 45. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use subtraction and division. Let me try another approach. Let me think of combining 49 and 1 first. For example, 49 - 1 = 48. Then maybe 96 - 72 = 24. Then 48 - 24 = 24. Not helpful. Alternatively, 48 divided by something. If I have 48 divided by (something) equals 36. Then that something would be 48/36 = 1.333... Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication and division. Let me think. Suppose I do 96 divided by (something) equals a number, then combine with others. For example, 96 divided by (something) equals 36. Then that something would be 96/36 = 8/3. How can I get 8/3 from the other numbers? Let me see. The other numbers are 49, 1, 72. Hmm. Maybe (72 - 49) divided by 1? That's 23. Not helpful. Or 72 divided by something. 72 divided by (something) equals 8/3. Then that something would be 72/(8/3) = 27. How to get 27 from 49 and 1? 49 - 1 = 48. Not 27. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 divided by something. Let me think. If I take 72 divided by (something) equals 36, then that something is 2. How to get 2 from 49, 1, 96. For example, (96 - 49 - 1) = 46. No. Or (49 - 1) = 48. Then 48 divided by something. Wait, if I have 48 divided by 24 equals 2. How to get 24 from 96? 96 divided by 4 equals 24. But again, how to get 4?\n\nAlternatively, think of combining 96 and 72. Let me try 96 - 72 = 24. Then I have 49 and 1 left. Maybe 24 + something equals 36. Then I need 12. How to get 12 from 49 and 1? 49 - 1 = 48. 48 divided by something? Not sure. Or 49 - (something) equals 12. That would require something to be 37. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication. Let's see. Suppose I take 1 multiplied by something. Since 1 doesn't change the value. Let me think. For example, (something) * 1 = something. So maybe I can focus on the other numbers. Let me try combining 49, 96, 72. Let me think of 96 - 72 = 24. Then 24 + 49 = 73. Not helpful. Or 96 - 49 = 47. Then 47 - 72 = -25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 - 49 = 23. Then 96 - 23 = 73. Still not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use division in a clever way. Let's think. For example, 96 divided by something. Let me think. Suppose I take 96 divided by (something) equals a number that can be combined with others. Let me think of 96 divided by (something) equals 36. As before, that would need 96/36 = 8/3. How to get 8/3 from the other numbers. Let me see. The other numbers are 49, 1, 72. Maybe 72 divided by something. 72 divided by (something) equals 8/3. Then that something would be 72 / (8/3) = 27. So how to get 27 from 49 and 1? 49 - 1 = 48. Not 27. 49 / something. 49 divided by something equals 27? That would require something to be 49/27, which is not helpful. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 49 and 1 first. Let me think of 49 - 1 = 48. Then 48 divided by something. Let me try 48 divided by (something) equals 36. Then that something is 48/36 = 4/3. How to get 4/3 from 96 and 72. Let's see. 96 divided by 72 is 1.333..., which is 4/3. Oh! Wait! 96 divided by 72 is 4/3. So if I have 48 divided by (96/72), that would be 48 * (72/96) = 48 * (3/4) = 36. Oh! Let me check that.\n\nSo, 48 divided by (96/72) equals 36. Let me write that step by step. \n\nFirst, 49 - 1 = 48. Then, 96 divided by 72 is 4/3. Then 48 divided by (4/3) is 48 * 3/4 = 36. Yes! That works. And all numbers are used: 49, 1, 96, 72. Each exactly once. \n\nSo the equation would be (49 - 1) / (96 / 72) = 36. Let me verify:\n\nCalculate denominator first: 96 / 72 = 1.333... which is 4/3. Then numerator is 48. So 48 divided by (4/3) is 48 * 3/4 = 36. Correct. \n\nSo the equation is (49 - 1) divided by (96 divided by 72). Which can be written as (49 - 1) / (96 / 72). Alternatively, using parentheses properly. Let me make sure the order of operations is correct. \n\nSo the full equation would be (49 - 1) / (96 / 72) = 36. \n\nAlternatively, since division is involved, maybe we can write it with multiplication by reciprocal. But according to the rules, we can use parentheses. So the expression would be (49 - 1) / (96 / 72). \n\nLet me check if all numbers are used once: 49, 1, 96, 72. Yes. Each is used once. \n\nSo that should be the correct equation. Let me just make sure there's no other way, but since the problem says there's a solution, this seems to work.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (49 - 1) / (96 / 72) </answer>",

We need to use all the numbers 49, 1, 96, and 72 exactly once with basic operations to get 36.\n\nFirst, let's look at the numbers and think about possible operations. The target is 36, which is a relatively small number compared to 49 and 96. That suggests maybe subtraction or division could help bring down larger numbers.\n\nLet me try some combinations. What if I subtract 1 from 49? That gives 48. Then I have 96 and 72 left. Hmm, 96 divided by 72 is 1.333... That doesn't seem helpful. What if I divide 96 by something?\n\nWait, what if I do (49 - 1) = 48. Then maybe divide that by (96 / 72). Let me calculate that. 96 divided by 72 is 1.333... So 48 divided by 1.333... is 36.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that I must use all four numbers once. So I can't leave any out. The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and I can use parentheses to control the order.\n\nLet me start by looking at the numbers: 49, 1, 96, 72. Hmm, 96 and 72 are both multiples of 24. 96 divided by 72 is 1.333..., which is 4/3. Wait, maybe that's useful. Also, 49 minus 1 is 48. Then 48 divided by something...

So if I can get 4/3 from 96 and 72, that would work. And 96 divided by 72 is indeed 4/3. So putting that together: (49 - 1) / (96 / 72) = 48 / (4/3) = 48 * (3/4) = 36.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, if I take 72 divided by (something) equals 36. Then that something would be 2. So 72 / 2 = 36. How can I get 2 from 49, 1, and 96? Let me see. For example, (96 - 49 - 1) = 46. No. Or 96 - (49 + 1) = 46. Still not 2. How about (49 - 1) divided by something? 48 divided by 24 is 2. But how to get 24 from 96? 96 divided by 4 is 24. But then I need to use 4. Wait, but I don't have a 4. Alternatively, maybe 96 divided by (something) equals 24. Let me think. If I have 96 divided by (something) equals 24, then that something is 4. How to get 4 from 49, 1, and maybe others? Wait, maybe 49 - (something). Let me think. 49 - (something) = 4. That would require something to be 45. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use subtraction and division. Let me try another approach. Let me think of combining 49 and 1 first. For example, 49 - 1 = 48. Then maybe 96 - 72 = 24. Then 48 - 24 = 24. Not helpful. Alternatively, 48 divided by something. If I have 48 divided by (something) equals 36. Then that something would be 48/36 = 1.333... Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication and division. Let me think. Suppose I do 96 divided by (something) equals a number, then combine with others. For example, 96 divided by (something) equals 36. Then that something would be 96/36 = 8/3. How can I get 8/3 from the other numbers? Let me see. The other numbers are 49, 1, 72. Hmm. Maybe (72 - 49) divided by 1? That's 23. Not helpful. Or 72 divided by something. 72 divided by (something) equals 8/3. Then that something would be 72/(8/3) = 27. How to get 27 from 49 and 1? 49 - 1 = 48. Not 27. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 divided by something. Let me think. If I take 72 divided by (something) equals 36, then that something is 2. How to get 2 from 49, 1, 96. For example, (96 - 49 - 1) = 46. No. Or (49 - 1) = 48. Then 48 divided by something. Wait, if I have 48 divided by 24 equals 2. How to get 24 from 96? 96 divided by 4 equals 24. But again, how to get 4?\n\nAlternatively, think of combining 96 and 72. Let me try 96 - 72 = 24. Then I have 49 and 1 left. Maybe 24 + something equals 36. Then I need 12. How to get 12 from 49 and 1? 49 - 1 = 48. 48 divided by something? Not sure. Or 49 - (something) equals 12. That would require something to be 37. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication. Let's see. Suppose I take 1 multiplied by something. Since 1 doesn't change the value. Let me think. For example, (something) * 1 = something. So maybe I can focus on the other numbers. Let me try combining 49, 96, 72. Let me think of 96 - 72 = 24. Then 24 + 49 = 73. Not helpful. Or 96 - 49 = 47. Then 47 - 72 = -25. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 - 49 = 23. Then 96 - 23 = 73. Still not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use division in a clever way. Let's think. For example, 96 divided by something. Let me think. Suppose I take 96 divided by (something) equals a number that can be combined with others. Let me think of 96 divided by (something) equals 36. As before, that would need 96/36 = 8/3. How to get 8/3 from the other numbers. Let me see. The other numbers are 49, 1, 72. Maybe 72 divided by something. 72 divided by (something) equals 8/3. Then that something would be 72 / (8/3) = 27. So how to get 27 from 49 and 1? 49 - 1 = 48. Not 27. 49 / something. 49 divided by something equals 27? That would require something to be 49/27, which is not helpful. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 49 and 1 first. Let me think of 49 - 1 = 48. Then 48 divided by something. Let me try 48 divided by (something) equals 36. Then that something is 48/36 = 4/3. How to get 4/3 from 96 and 72. Let's see. 96 divided by 72 is 1.333..., which is 4/3. Oh! Wait! 96 divided by 72 is 4/3. So if I have 48 divided by (96/72), that would be 48 * (72/96) = 48 * (3/4) = 36. Oh! Let me check that.\n\nSo, 48 divided by (96/72) equals 36. Let me write that step by step. \n\nFirst, 49 - 1 = 48. Then, 96 divided by 72 is 4/3. Then 48 divided by (4/3) is 48 * 3/4 = 36. Yes! That works. And all numbers are used: 49, 1, 96, 72. Each exactly once. \n\nSo the equation would be (49 - 1) / (96 / 72) = 36. Let me verify:\n\nCalculate denominator first: 96 / 72 = 1.333... which is 4/3. Then numerator is 48. So 48 divided by (4/3) is 48 * 3/4 = 36. Correct. \n\nSo the equation is (49 - 1) divided by (96 divided by 72). Which can be written as (49 - 1) / (96 / 72). Alternatively, using parentheses properly. Let me make sure the order of operations is correct. \n\nSo the full equation would be (49 - 1) / (96 / 72) = 36. \n\nAlternatively, since division is involved, maybe we can write it with multiplication by reciprocal. But according to the rules, we can use parentheses. So the expression would be (49 - 1) / (96 / 72). \n\nLet me check if all numbers are used once: 49, 1, 96, 72. Yes. Each is used once. \n\nSo that should be the correct equation. Let me just make sure there's no other way, but since the problem says there's a solution, this seems to work.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (49 - 1) / (96 / 72) </answer>",

Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in the previous attempts, the answer was (49 - 1) / (96 / 72). Let me check if that works. \n\nCalculating the numerator: 49 - 1 is 48. Then the denominator: 96 divided by 72 is 1.333... So 48 divided by 1.333... equals 36. That's correct! So that equation does work. \n\nWait, but maybe I should verify again. Let me write it out:\n\n(49 - 1) = 48  \n96 / 72 = 1.333...  \n48 / (96 / 72) = 48 * (72 / 96) = 48 * 0.75 = 36. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the equation (49 - 1) / (96 / 72) equals 36, and it uses all four numbers exactly once. The operations are subtraction, division, and division again.

Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for ways to combine some numbers to get closer to 20. Since 89 is a large number, maybe subtracting it from something? Or perhaps dividing? Let me think. Let's list the numbers again: 19, 60, 89, 32. Target is 20.\n\nLet me think about possible operations. Let's see, if I can find a way to subtract two larger numbers to get a smaller one. For example, 89 minus 60 is 29. Then maybe combine that with others? But then I still have 19 and 32 left. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 60 divided by something? Let's see. 60 divided by 3 is 20, but I don't have a 3. Wait, but maybe I can create 3 from other numbers? Like 32 - 19 is 13, not helpful. Or 89 - 60 is 29, then 29 minus something... Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe combining numbers through multiplication or division. Let me think. Let's try to think of fractions. For example, if I can get a fraction that when multiplied by another number gives 20. Let me try some possibilities.\n\nWhat if I take 89 minus 60? That's 29. Then maybe subtract 32? 29 - 32 is -3. Then add 19? -3 +19 is 16. Not 20. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 32 minus 19 is 13. Then maybe 60 minus 89 is -29. Then 13 plus (-29) is -16. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe multiplication. Let's think. Suppose I multiply two numbers and then do something else. For example, 19 + 32 is 51. Then 60 - 89 is -29. 51 + (-29) is 22. Close to 20, but not quite. Maybe subtract something else?\n\nWait, but I have to use all numbers once. So maybe I need to combine them in a way that uses all four numbers. Let me think of grouping them. For example, (a op b) op (c op d) = 20.\n\nLet me try different groupings. Let's try (89 - 60) = 29. Then maybe (32 - 19) = 13. Then 29 - 13 = 16. Not enough. Or 29 - 13 is 16. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do (89 - 32) = 57. Then 60 - 19 = 41. Then 57 - 41 = 16 again. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (60 - 32) = 28. Then 89 - 19 = 70. 28 - 70 = -42. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Let me think of division. Maybe dividing a larger number by something. For example, 89 divided by something. Let me see. If I can get 89 divided by something to get a number that when combined with others gives 20. Let's think.\n\nSuppose 89 divided by (something) equals part of the equation. Let me think. For example, 89 divided by (something) plus or minus other numbers. Let me think. Let's say 89 divided by (something) equals 20. Then that something would be 89/20 = 4.45. But how to get that from the other numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe 60 divided by something. Let's think. 60 divided by 3 is 20. How to get 3 from the other numbers? Let's see. 32 - 19 is 13. 89 - something? Not sure. Or maybe (89 - 32) is 57, then 57 divided by something? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe combining numbers with subtraction and division. Let me think. For example, 89 - 60 = 29. Then 32 - 19 = 13. Then 29 - 13 = 16. Not helpful. But maybe 29 divided by something? Like 29 divided by (something) equals part of the equation. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (something) multiplied by (something else) equals 20. Let's think. For example, 5 * 4 = 20. How to get 5 and 4 from the numbers? Let's see. 32 - 27 = 5, but where would 27 come from? Maybe 89 - 60 - 19 = 10? Not helpful. Or 60 divided by something? 60 / 15 = 4. How to get 15? 32 - 19 = 13, 89 - 60 = 29. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let me think of combining three numbers first, then using the fourth. For example, 60 - 32 = 28. Then 28 - 19 = 9. Then 89 - 9 = 80. Not helpful. Or 89 - (60 - 32) = 89 - 28 = 61. Then 61 - 19 = 42. No.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's think. Suppose I have 89 - (something) equals 20. Then that something would be 69. How to get 69 from the other numbers? Let's see. 60 + 32 - 19 = 73. No. 60 + 19 = 79, minus 32 is 47. Not 69. 32 + 19 = 51, 60 - 51 = 9. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 60 divided by something. Let me think. 60 divided by (something) equals part of the equation. Let's say 60 / (something) + something else = 20. For example, if I can get 60 / 3 = 20, but how to get 3? Maybe (89 - 32 - 19) = 38. No. Or (89 - 60) = 29. 29 - 32 = -3. Then 60 / (-3) = -20. Then adding 19? -20 + 19 = -1. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining operations. Let me think of fractions. Let me try:\n\nSuppose I do 89 - (60 + 32) = 89 - 92 = -3. Then add 19? -3 +19 = 16. Not 20.\n\nAlternatively, 89 - 60 = 29. Then 29 - (32 / 19). Wait, 32 divided by 19 is about 1.68. So 29 - 1.68 is about 27.32. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe multiplication and division. Let's think. For example, (something) * (something else) / (another) = 20. Let me try.\n\nWhat if I take 60 * 19 = 1140. Then divide by something. Let's see, 1140 divided by 89 is about 12.8. Then subtract 32? 12.8 - 32 is negative. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 32 * 19 = 608. Divided by something. 608 divided by 89 is about 6.83. Then subtract 60? 6.83 -60 = -53.17. No.\n\nHmm. What if I do (89 - 32) = 57. Then 57 - 60 = -3. Then -3 + 19 = 16. Still not 20.\n\nWait, maybe 89 - (something) equals 20. So that something is 69. How to get 69 from 60, 32, 19. Let's see. 60 + 32 = 92. 92 - 19 = 73. No. 60 + 19 = 79 - 32 = 47. No. 32 + 19 = 51. 60 - 51 = 9. Not helpful. 60 - 32 = 28. 28 + 19 = 47. No. Not 69.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe using division in a clever way. Let me think. Suppose I have 60 divided by (something) equals part of the equation. Let's say 60 divided by (something) equals 20. Then that something would be 3. How to get 3 from the other numbers? Let's see. 32 - 19 = 13. 89 - something? Not sure. Or maybe (89 - 32 - 19) = 38. No. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (something) divided by (something else) equals a number that when combined with others gives 20. For example, (89 - 60) = 29. Then 29 divided by (something) equals part of the equation. Let me think. If I have 29 divided by (something) plus something else equals 20. For example, 29 / x + y = 20. But I need to use all numbers once. Let me think. If I use 32 and 19. Let me try 29 divided by (32 - 19) = 29 / 13 \u2248 2.23. Then adding something? But I already used 89, 60, 32, 19. Wait, no. If I do 89 - 60 = 29, then 32 - 19 = 13. So then 29 divided by 13 is about 2.23. But then how to get to 20? Maybe multiply by something? But I already used all numbers. So that approach might not work.\n\nWait, maybe combining operations in a different way. Let me think. What if I do (something) multiplied by (something else) minus another. For example, (60 - 32) * something. 60 - 32 = 28. Then 28 * something. Let me see. If I can get 28 * (something) = 20. Then that something would be 20/28 = 5/7. How to get 5/7 from 89 and 19? Maybe 89 - 19 = 70. 70 divided by something? 70 divided by 14 is 5. But how to get 14? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (something) divided by (something else) equals 5/7. Like 89 divided by something equals 5/7. But that seems complicated.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of fractions. Let me think. Suppose I have 89 - (something) = 20. Then that something is 69. How to get 69 from 60, 32, 19. Let me try 60 + (32 - 19) = 60 + 13 = 73. No. 60 + 32 = 92. 92 - 19 = 73. Still not 69. 60 + 19 = 79. 79 - 32 = 47. No. 32 + 19 = 51. 60 - 51 = 9. No. 60 - 32 = 28. 28 + 19 = 47. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe using subtraction and division. Let me think. Let's try 89 - (60 / (32 - 19)). Let me compute that. 32 - 19 is 13. 60 divided by 13 is approximately 4.615. Then 89 - 4.615 is about 84.38. Not 20. But maybe if I do something else. What if I do (89 - 60) / (32 - 19)? That's 29 / 13 \u2248 2.23. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (something) multiplied by (something else) divided by another. Let me think. For example, (60 * 19) / (something) = 20. Let's compute 60 * 19 = 1140. So 1140 divided by something equals 20. That something would be 1140 / 20 = 57. How to get 57 from 89 and 32? 89 - 32 = 57! Oh! Wait, that's possible. Let me check:\n\nSo if I do (60 * 19) divided by (89 - 32) equals 20?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n60 * 19 = 1140.\n\n89 - 32 = 57.\n\n1140 / 57 = 20. Exactly!\n\nYes! Because 57 * 20 = 1140. So that works. And I used all four numbers: 60, 19, 89, 32. Each exactly once. So the equation would be (60 * 19) / (89 - 32) = 20.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nFirst, compute denominator: 89 - 32 = 57.\n\nThen numerator: 60 * 19 = 1140.\n\nDivide them: 1140 / 57 = 20. Correct.\n\nYes! That works. So the equation is (60 * 19) / (89 - 32) = 20. Let me make sure I used all numbers once: 60, 19, 89, 32. Yes, all are there. Operations are multiplication, subtraction, division. Parentheses are used properly. So this should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (60 * 19) / (89 - 32) </answer>",

So that approach might not work.\n\nWait, maybe combining operations in a different way. Let me think. What if I do (something) multiplied by (something else) minus another. For example, (60 - 32) * something. 60 - 32 = 28. Then 28 * something. Let me see. If I can get 28 * (something) = 20. Then that something would be 20/28 = 5/7. How to get 5/7 from 89 and 19? Maybe 89 - 19 = 70. 70 divided by something? 70 divided by 14 is 5. But how to get 14? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (something) divided by (something else) equals 5/7. Like 89 divided by something equals 5/7. But that seems complicated.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of fractions. Let me think. Suppose I have 89 - (something) = 20. Then that something is 69. How to get 69 from 60, 32, 19. Let me try 60 + (32 - 19) = 60 + 13 = 73. No. 60 + 32 = 92. 92 - 19 = 73. Still not 69. 60 + 19 = 79. 79 - 32 = 47. No. 32 + 19 = 51. 60 - 51 = 9. No. 60 - 32 = 28. 28 + 19 = 47. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe using subtraction and division. Let me think. Let's try 89 - (60 / (32 - 19)). Let me compute that. 32 - 19 is 13. 60 divided by 13 is approximately 4.615. Then 89 - 4.615 is about 84.38. Not 20. But maybe if I do something else. What if I do (89 - 60) / (32 - 19)? That's 29 / 13 \u2248 2.23. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (something) multiplied by (something else) divided by another. Let me think. For example, (60 * 19) / (something) = 20. Let's compute 60 * 19 = 1140. So 1140 divided by something equals 20. That something would be 1140 / 20 = 57. How to get 57 from 89 and 32? 89 - 32 = 57! Oh! Wait, that's possible. Let me check:\n\nSo if I do (60 * 19) divided by (89 - 32) equals 20?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n60 * 19 = 1140.\n\n89 - 32 = 57.\n\n1140 / 57 = 20. Exactly!\n\nYes! Because 57 * 20 = 1140. So that works. And I used all four numbers: 60, 19, 89, 32. Each exactly once. So the equation would be (60 * 19) / (89 - 32) = 20.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nFirst, compute denominator: 89 - 32 = 57.\n\nThen numerator: 60 * 19 = 1140.\n\nDivide them: 1140 / 57 = 20. Correct.\n\nYes! That works. So the equation is (60 * 19) / (89 - 32) = 20. Let me make sure I used all numbers once: 60, 19, 89, 32. Yes, all are there. Operations are multiplication, subtraction, division. Parentheses are used properly. So this should be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (60 * 19) / (89 - 32) </answer>",

The operations allowed are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses. Each number must be used exactly once.\n\nFirst, I'll think about possible combinations. Let me start by checking if any simple operations could work. For example, maybe subtracting some numbers or dividing them.\n\nLet me try looking at the numbers 89 and 32. If I subtract them, 89 - 32 = 57. Then I have 19 and 60 left. Hmm, 60 divided by something? Wait, 60 divided by 3 is 20, but I don't have a 3. What if I use 19 and 57 somehow? 57 divided by 19 is 3. Then 60 divided by 3 is 20. Oh, that seems promising!\n\nSo let me break it down step by step. First, subtract 32 from 89: 89 - 32 = 57. Then divide that result by 19: 57 / 19 = 3. Then divide 60 by that result: 60 / 3 = 20. \n\nSo putting it all together: (60 / ((89 - 32) / 19)) = 20. Let me check the order of operations. First, 89 - 32 = 57. Then 57 / 19 = 3. Then 60 / 3 = 20. Yep, that works!\n\nI used all the numbers: 19, 60, 89, and 32. Each number is used exactly once. The operations are all allowed. And the parentheses ensure the correct order.

Each number has to be used exactly once, and I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses. Hmm, let's start by thinking about possible operations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for ways to combine some numbers to get closer to 62. Let me list the numbers again: 4, 42, 43, 92. The target is 62. Let me think about the larger numbers first. 92 is quite big. If I subtract something from it, maybe? Like 92 minus something equals 62. Let's check: 92 - 30 = 62. So if I can make 30 from the remaining numbers 4, 42, 43. Wait, but I have to use all numbers. So maybe that approach isn't directly working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining some numbers. Let me think. Let's see, 43 minus 42 is 1. Then maybe 1 multiplied by something? But then I still have 92 and 4 left. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother idea: 42 + 4 is 46. Then 43 - something? Not sure. Let me think of other combinations. What if I take 92 and subtract 43? That's 49. Then maybe add 4 and subtract 42? Wait, 49 +4 is 53, minus 42 would be 11. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 43 - (something) equals part of the equation. Let me think. Let's think of possible divisions or multiplications. For example, 92 divided by something. Let's see: 92 divided by 4 is 23. Then maybe 23 plus something? If I have 23 plus 42 minus 43? That would be 23 + 42 = 65 - 43 = 22. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 42 divided by something. Let's see. 42 divided by 4 is 10.5. Not sure. Maybe not useful. Let's think again.\n\nWhat if I take 43 - 4 = 39. Then 92 - 42 = 50. Then 39 + 50 = 89. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 43 + 4 = 47. 92 - 42 = 50. 47 + 50 = 97. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication. Let me think. Let's see, 4 times something. Let's say 4 times 42 is 168. Then maybe subtract something. But 168 minus 92 is 76. Then subtract 43? 76 -43 is 33. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 4 times (something). Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, 92 - 43 = 49. Then 49 + 4 = 53. Then 53 + 42 = 95. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining subtraction and addition. Let me think. Let's try 92 - 43 = 49. Then 49 - 42 = 7. Then 7 * 4 = 28. No. Not 62.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use division. Let's think. Let's say 92 divided by something. For example, 92 divided by (43 - 42) equals 92 divided by 1, which is 92. Then subtract 4? 92 -4 = 88. Not helpful. Or maybe 92 divided by something else. Let me think. What if I do 42 divided by (something) to get a useful number. For example, 42 divided by 4 is 10.5. Then 10.5 plus 43 minus 92? That would be 10.5 +43=53.5 -92= -38.5. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the target 62. Let me think of possible combinations that can reach 62. For example, 62 is 42 + 20. How can I get 20 from 4, 43, 92? Maybe 92 - 43 - 4 = 45. Not 20. Or 43 - (92 / something). Wait, 92 divided by 4 is 23. Then 43 -23 = 20. Oh! Wait, that's interesting. Let me check:\n\nIf I take 43 minus (92 divided by 4) equals 43 - 23 = 20. Then adding 42 would give 42 + 20 = 62. Wait, but then I have used 43, 92, 4, and 42. All numbers. Let me check:\n\nSo the equation would be 42 + (43 - (92 / 4)) = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step. 92 divided by 4 is 23. Then 43 minus 23 is 20. Then 42 + 20 is 62. Yes! That works. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 42, 43, 92, 4. Yes, all are used once. And operations are division, subtraction, addition. Parentheses are used appropriately. So the equation would be 42 + (43 - (92 / 4)).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the order of operations is correct. Let me write it with parentheses properly. So 42 + (43 - (92 / 4)). Yes. So that's valid. Let me check the calculation again:\n\n92 divided by 4 is 23. 43 minus 23 is 20. 42 plus 20 is 62. Correct. So that seems to work. Therefore, the answer is 42 + (43 - (92 / 4)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems to work. Let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, are there any rules I'm breaking? The numbers are all used once. Operations are allowed. Parentheses are used. Yes. So this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 42 + (43 - (92 / 4)) </answer>",

So if I do 92 / 4 = 23, then maybe I can use that with the other numbers. Let's see: 42 + 43 is 85. If I subtract 23 from that, 85 - 23 = 62. Oh! That works!\n\nSo putting it all together: (42 + 43) - (92 / 4) = 62. Let me check again. 42 + 43 is 85. 92 divided by 4 is 23. 85 minus 23 is indeed 62. And I used all four numbers exactly once. That seems to satisfy all the rules. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer> (42 + 43) - (92 / 4) </answer>",

Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nOne idea is to see if any of the numbers can be combined to get closer to 62. For example, 42 + 43 is 85, which is higher than 62. Maybe subtract something from that. If I subtract 92 divided by 4, that's 23. So 85 - 23 = 62. Wait, that works!\n\nLet me check: 42 + 43 = 85. Then 92 divided by 4 is 23. So 85 - 23 = 62.

      "initial_reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to use all the numbers 4, 42, 43, and 92 to make an equation that equals 62. Each number has to be used exactly once, and I can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses. Hmm, let's start by thinking about possible operations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for ways to combine some numbers to get closer to 62. Let me list the numbers again: 4, 42, 43, 92. The target is 62. Let me think about the larger numbers first. 92 is quite big. If I subtract something from it, maybe? Like 92 minus something equals 62. Let's check: 92 - 30 = 62. So if I can make 30 from the remaining numbers 4, 42, 43. Wait, but I have to use all numbers. So maybe that approach isn't directly working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining some numbers. Let me think. Let's see, 43 minus 42 is 1. Then maybe 1 multiplied by something? But then I still have 92 and 4 left. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother idea: 42 + 4 is 46. Then 43 - something? Not sure. Let me think of other combinations. What if I take 92 and subtract 43? That's 49. Then maybe add 4 and subtract 42? Wait, 49 +4 is 53, minus 42 would be 11. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 43 - (something) equals part of the equation. Let me think. Let's think of possible divisions or multiplications. For example, 92 divided by something. Let's see: 92 divided by 4 is 23. Then maybe 23 plus something? If I have 23 plus 42 minus 43? That would be 23 + 42 = 65 - 43 = 22. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 42 divided by something. Let's see. 42 divided by 4 is 10.5. Not sure. Maybe not useful. Let's think again.\n\nWhat if I take 43 - 4 = 39. Then 92 - 42 = 50. Then 39 + 50 = 89. No. Not helpful. Alternatively, 43 + 4 = 47. 92 - 42 = 50. 47 + 50 = 97. Still not.\n\nWait, maybe multiplication. Let me think. Let's see, 4 times something. Let's say 4 times 42 is 168. Then maybe subtract something. But 168 minus 92 is 76. Then subtract 43? 76 -43 is 33. Not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 4 times (something). Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, 92 - 43 = 49. Then 49 + 4 = 53. Then 53 + 42 = 95. No. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining subtraction and addition. Let me think. Let's try 92 - 43 = 49. Then 49 - 42 = 7. Then 7 * 4 = 28. No. Not 62.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to use division. Let's think. Let's say 92 divided by something. For example, 92 divided by (43 - 42) equals 92 divided by 1, which is 92. Then subtract 4? 92 -4 = 88. Not helpful. Or maybe 92 divided by something else. Let me think. What if I do 42 divided by (something) to get a useful number. For example, 42 divided by 4 is 10.5. Then 10.5 plus 43 minus 92? That would be 10.5 +43=53.5 -92= -38.5. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the target 62. Let me think of possible combinations that can reach 62. For example, 62 is 42 + 20. How can I get 20 from 4, 43, 92? Maybe 92 - 43 - 4 = 45. Not 20. Or 43 - (92 / something). Wait, 92 divided by 4 is 23. Then 43 -23 = 20. Oh! Wait, that's interesting. Let me check:\n\nIf I take 43 minus (92 divided by 4) equals 43 - 23 = 20. Then adding 42 would give 42 + 20 = 62. Wait, but then I have used 43, 92, 4, and 42. All numbers. Let me check:\n\nSo the equation would be 42 + (43 - (92 / 4)) = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step. 92 divided by 4 is 23. Then 43 minus 23 is 20. Then 42 + 20 is 62. Yes! That works. Let me check if all numbers are used once: 42, 43, 92, 4. Yes, all are used once. And operations are division, subtraction, addition. Parentheses are used appropriately. So the equation would be 42 + (43 - (92 / 4)).\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the order of operations is correct. Let me write it with parentheses properly. So 42 + (43 - (92 / 4)). Yes. So that's valid. Let me check the calculation again:\n\n92 divided by 4 is 23. 43 minus 23 is 20. 42 plus 20 is 62. Correct. So that seems to work. Therefore, the answer is 42 + (43 - (92 / 4)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way, but this seems to work. Let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, are there any rules I'm breaking? The numbers are all used once. Operations are allowed. Parentheses are used. Yes. So this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 42 + (43 - (92 / 4)) </answer>",

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for ways to combine some numbers to get closer to 51. Let me list the numbers again: 90, 12, 78, 50. All have to be used once. Let me think about possible operations.\n\nSince 90 is quite a big number, maybe subtracting it with something else? Or maybe combining smaller numbers first. Let me try different combinations.\n\nLet me think about possible pairs. For example, 90 minus something. If I subtract 78 from 90, that gives 12. Wait, but then I have 12 left. But I already have 12 in the list. Wait, but I need to use all numbers once. So maybe that's not helpful. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 12 and 50. 12 + 50 is 62. Then 78 - 62 is 16. Then 90 - 16 is 74. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I try division? Let's see. For example, 90 divided by something. Let's see. 90 divided by 12 is 7.5. Not sure. Maybe 78 divided by something? 78 divided by 12 is 6.5. Not helpful. Maybe 50 divided by something?\n\nAlternatively, think about combining numbers to get numbers that can be used in operations. Let me think about target 51. Maybe 51 can be achieved by adding or subtracting some numbers. Let me think of 51 as a result of operations.\n\nWait, 51 is 50 + 1. But how to get 1 from the other numbers? Let's see. If I can get 1 from 90, 12, 78. For example, (90 - 78) - (12 / something)? Wait, 90 - 78 is 12. Then 12 divided by 12 is 1. But then I have used 90, 78, and 12. Then 50 is left. But how to combine them. Wait, maybe 50 + ((90 - 78) / 12) = 50 + (12/12) = 50 +1=51. Oh! Wait, but that uses 90, 78, 12, and 50. Let me check:\n\nSo the equation would be 50 + ((90 - 78) / 12). Let me compute that. 90 -78 is 12. 12 divided by 12 is 1. 50 +1 is 51. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 90, 78, 12, 50. Perfect!\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm using each number once. The numbers used are 90, 78, 12, and 50. Yes, all four numbers. So that works. Let me write that as an equation. So 50 + ((90 - 78) / 12). Let me check the order of operations. Parentheses first: 90-78=12, then divided by 12 gives 1. Then add 50. Yep. So that equals 51. So that's a valid solution.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities, but since the problem says there's a solution, maybe this is the one. Let me confirm once again. Numbers used: 90, 78, 12, 50. All used once. Operations are subtraction, division, addition. All allowed. Parentheses used correctly. So yes, this should be correct.\n\nSo the equation is 50 + ( (90 - 78) / 12 ). Let me write that with proper parentheses. Alternatively, maybe written as 50 + (90 - 78) / 12. Since division has higher precedence than addition, but parentheses make it clear. So the answer would be 50 + ( (90 - 78) / 12 ). Which equals 51.

Maybe start with subtraction or division since those can reduce numbers. For example, 90 - 78 is 12. Wait, but 12 is already one of the numbers. That might be useful. So if I do 90 - 78 = 12, then I have two 12s, but I can't use numbers more than once. So that might not help directly.\n\nWhat if I try dividing? Let's see: 90 divided by something? 90 / 12 is 7.5, which might not be helpful. How about 78 divided by something? 78 / 12 is 6.5. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can do something like 50 + something equals 51. So 50 + 1 = 51. Can I make 1 from the remaining numbers 90, 12, 78? Let's see. If I can make 1 from 90, 12, 78, then adding to 50 would work.\n\nHow to make 1? Maybe (90 - 78) / 12. Let's check: 90 - 78 is 12, then 12 / 12 is 1. Oh! That works. So then the equation would be 50 + ((90 - 78) / 12) = 50 + 1 = 51.\n\nYes, that uses all numbers exactly once: 90, 78, 12, and 50. Each number is used once, and operations are valid.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look for ways to combine some numbers to get closer to 51. Let me list the numbers again: 90, 12, 78, 50. All have to be used once. Let me think about possible operations.\n\nSince 90 is quite a big number, maybe subtracting it with something else? Or maybe combining smaller numbers first. Let me try different combinations.\n\nLet me think about possible pairs. For example, 90 minus something. If I subtract 78 from 90, that gives 12. Wait, but then I have 12 left. But I already have 12 in the list. Wait, but I need to use all numbers once. So maybe that's not helpful. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 12 and 50. 12 + 50 is 62. Then 78 - 62 is 16. Then 90 - 16 is 74. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I try division? Let's see. For example, 90 divided by something. Let's see. 90 divided by 12 is 7.5. Not sure. Maybe 78 divided by something? 78 divided by 12 is 6.5. Not helpful. Maybe 50 divided by something?\n\nAlternatively, think about combining numbers to get numbers that can be used in operations. Let me think about target 51. Maybe 51 can be achieved by adding or subtracting some numbers. Let me think of 51 as a result of operations.\n\nWait, 51 is 50 + 1. But how to get 1 from the other numbers? Let's see. If I can get 1 from 90, 12, 78. For example, (90 - 78) - (12 / something)? Wait, 90 - 78 is 12. Then 12 divided by 12 is 1. But then I have used 90, 78, and 12. Then 50 is left. But how to combine them. Wait, maybe 50 + ((90 - 78) / 12) = 50 + (12/12) = 50 +1=51. Oh! Wait, but that uses 90, 78, 12, and 50. Let me check:\n\nSo the equation would be 50 + ((90 - 78) / 12). Let me compute that. 90 -78 is 12. 12 divided by 12 is 1. 50 +1 is 51. Yes! And all numbers are used once: 90, 78, 12, 50. Perfect!\n\nWait, but let me make sure that I'm using each number once. The numbers used are 90, 78, 12, and 50. Yes, all four numbers. So that works. Let me write that as an equation. So 50 + ((90 - 78) / 12). Let me check the order of operations. Parentheses first: 90-78=12, then divided by 12 gives 1. Then add 50. Yep. So that equals 51. So that's a valid solution.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possibilities, but since the problem says there's a solution, maybe this is the one. Let me confirm once again. Numbers used: 90, 78, 12, 50. All used once. Operations are subtraction, division, addition. All allowed. Parentheses used correctly. So yes, this should be correct.\n\nSo the equation is 50 + ( (90 - 78) / 12 ). Let me write that with proper parentheses. Alternatively, maybe written as 50 + (90 - 78) / 12. Since division has higher precedence than addition, but parentheses make it clear. So the answer would be 50 + ( (90 - 78) / 12 ). Which equals 51. Yep.\n</think>\n\n<answer>50 + (90 - 78) / 12</answer>",

The target is 51. Let me think about how these numbers can interact. \n\nOne approach is to see if any of the numbers can be subtracted or divided to get smaller numbers. For example, 88 is quite large. Maybe if I subtract something from it? Let's see. If I take 88 and subtract something, maybe 88 - 44 = 44. But then I still have 54 and 6 left. Not sure. Alternatively, 88 - 54 = 34. Then maybe combine with others?\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 44 and 54. Let me think: 44 + 54 = 98. Then 98 minus something? If I subtract 88, that would be 10. Then add 6? 10 + 6 = 16. No, that's not helpful. \n\nWait, maybe division could help. Let's see. For example, 54 divided by something. 54 divided by 6 is 9. Then maybe combine with others. Let's try that. If I do 54 / 6 = 9. Then I have 88 and 44 left. How can I combine 88 and 44 to get 51 - 9 = 42? Wait, 88 - 44 is 44. That's not 42. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 88 - (something) equals 42? Let me think. If I have 88 - 44 = 44, then 44 - something? But I already used 88 and 44. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about 51. Maybe 51 is 54 - 3. How can I get 3 from the other numbers? Let's see. 6 divided by something? If I have 6 divided by (something) equals 3. Well, 6 divided by 2 is 3. But I don't have a 2. Wait, but maybe using 88 and 44? Let me see. 88 divided by 44 is 2. Oh! So if I take 54 - (6 / (88 / 44)) ?\n\nLet me check that. Let's compute 88 divided by 44 first. That's 2. Then 6 divided by 2 is 3. Then 54 minus 3 is 51. Oh! Wait, that uses all numbers: 54, 6, 88, 44. Let me check again:\n\nSo the equation would be 54 - (6 / (88 / 44)) = ?\n\nCalculating denominator first: 88 / 44 = 2. Then 6 / 2 = 3. Then 54 - 3 = 51. Yes! That works. Let me make sure I used all numbers once. 54, 6, 88, 44. Yes, each is used once. And the operations are division and subtraction. So that's valid. \n\nWait, but how to write this with parentheses? Let me structure it properly. The equation would be 54 - (6 / (88 / 44)). Let me check the order of operations. The inner division is done first, then the division of 6 by that result, then subtract from 54. Yes. \n\nSo that equation should work. Let me verify once more. 88 divided by 44 is 2. Then 6 divided by 2 is 3. Then 54 minus 3 is 51. Perfect. All numbers are used once. Operations allowed. Parentheses are used correctly. \n\nI think that's the solution. Let me see if there are other possibilities, but since the problem says there's a valid solution, this should be correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 54 - (6 / (88 / 44)) </answer>",

Yep, that works!\n\nI used all the numbers exactly once, and the operations are valid. So the equation is correct.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 54 - (6 / (88 / 44)) </answer>",

          "reasoning": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I need to use all the numbers 9, 44, 53, and 18 exactly once with basic operations to get 7. Hmm. Let me start by thinking about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for ways to combine some numbers to get closer to 7. Let me think about subtraction or division since those can reduce numbers. For example, 53 minus 44 is 9. Wait, but then I still have 9 and 18 left. If I do 53 - 44 = 9, then I have two 9s? No, wait, the original numbers are 9, 44, 53, 18. So if I subtract 44 from 53, that gives me 9. Then I have the original 9 and 18. But I can't use numbers more than once. Wait, so maybe that's not helpful. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining 44 and 18. Let's see. 44 divided by something? Or 44 minus 18 is 26. Then 53 minus 26 is 27. Then 27 minus 9 is 18. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I try to use division? For example, 53 minus something equals 7. Let's see. If 53 - x = 7, then x would be 46. How can I get 46 from the other numbers? The other numbers are 9, 44, 18. Let's see. 44 + (something) = 46? 44 + 2 = 46. But how to get 2 from 9 and 18? 18 - 9 = 9. Not 2. Or 9 - (something). Maybe 18 divided by 9 is 2. Oh! Wait. So if I do 18 / 9 = 2. Then 44 + 2 = 46. Then 53 - 46 = 7. But then I have used 53, 44, 18, and 9. Yes! All numbers. Let me check that again.\n\nSo the equation would be 53 - (44 + (18 / 9)) = 7. Let me compute that step by step. 18 divided by 9 is 2. Then 44 + 2 is 46. Then 53 - 46 is 7. Yes! That works. Let me make sure I used all numbers once. 53, 44, 18, 9. Yes, each is used once. And the operations are division, addition, subtraction. All allowed. So that should be the answer.\n\nWait, but how to write this with parentheses? Let me structure it properly. The expression would be 53 - (44 + (18 / 9)). Let me check the order. Since division comes first, then addition, then subtraction. So parentheses are needed. Alternatively, maybe 53 - 44 - (18 / 9) would be 9 - 2 = 7? Wait, no. Wait 53 - 44 is 9. Then subtract (18/9)=2. So 9 - 2 =7. Oh! That's another way. So that would be 53 - 44 - (18 / 9). Which is the same as 53 - (44 + (18/9))? Wait no. Wait, 53 - 44 - (18/9) is equal to (53 - 44) - (18/9) which is 9 - 2 =7. But the original idea was 53 - (44 + 18/9) which is 53 - 46 =7. Both ways are correct. So either way, the parentheses can be arranged. But in terms of using all numbers, both approaches are valid. So maybe the equation can be written as 53 - 44 - (18 / 9). Let me check again. 53 -44 is 9, then subtract 2 gives 7. Yes. So that uses all numbers once. So that's a valid equation.\n\nSo the answer would be 53 - 44 - (18 / 9). Let me check if that's correct. 18 divided by 9 is 2. 53 minus 44 is 9. 9 minus 2 is 7. Yes. Perfect. So that's the equation. So the final answer is that expression.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 53 - 44 - (18 / 9) </answer>",

The goal is to use all the numbers [9, 44, 53, 18] exactly once with basic operations to get 7.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the numbers: 9, 44, 53, and 18. I need to combine them using +, -, *, / and parentheses. Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nOne idea is to subtract some numbers from others. For example, 53 - 44 gives 9. Then I have 9 and 18 left. If I divide 18 by 9, that's 2. Then 9 - 2 is 7. Wait, but that would use 53, 44, 18, and 9. Let me check:\n\n(53 - 44) = 9  \n18 / 9 = 2  \nThen 9 - 2 = 7\n\nBut I already used 9 in the first step. Oh, right, I can't reuse numbers. Wait, I used 53, 44, 18, and 9 in that process. That's all four numbers. So the equation would be (53 - 44) - (18 / 9) = 7. Let me verify:\n\n53 - 44 = 9  \n18 / 9 = 2  \n9 - 2 = 7\n\nYes, that works! All numbers are used once, and the operations are valid. So the correct answer is (53 - 44) - (18 / 9).\n</think>\n\n<answer> (53 - 44) - (18 / 9) </answer>",
