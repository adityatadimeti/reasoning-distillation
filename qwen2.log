The rules say I have to use each number exactly once and can only use the operations +, -, *, and /. Also, I can use parentheses to control the order of operations. \n\nFirst, I should probably list out the numbers I have: 49, 1, 96, 72. My target is 36. Hmm, 36 is less than all these numbers except 49, which is actually larger, so maybe I need to subtract or divide some of these numbers to get down to 36.\n\nLet me think about the largest numbers first. 96 is pretty big, so maybe if I can divide 96 by something to get it down to a manageable number. 96 divided by 2 is 48, which is close to 49, but I don't have a 2. Wait, I do have a 1, though. Maybe 96 minus something. Let's see, 96 minus 60 would be 36, but I don't have a 60. Alternatively, 96 divided by something else.\n\nLooking at 72, maybe I can subtract 72 from another number. 72 minus 36 is 36, but again, I don't have a 36. Alternatively, maybe 72 divided by 2 is 36, but again, I don't have a 2. Wait, but I have a 1, so maybe 72 divided by (something involving 1). Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nLet me think about combining 49 and 1. Maybe 49 minus 1 is 48, which is close to 49. Or 49 divided by 1 is still 49, which doesn't help much. Alternatively, 49 plus 1 is 50, which is close to 50, but not sure how that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can use 72 and 96 together. If I subtract 72 from 96, I get 24. Then maybe 49 minus 24 is 25, which isn't 36. Alternatively, 72 minus 96 is negative, which might complicate things.\n\nAnother approach: maybe multiply two numbers and then subtract or add the others. For example, if I multiply 49 and 1, that's 49, which isn't helpful. 72 times something? 72 times 1 is 72, which is too big. 96 times something? 96 times 1 is 96, which is too big.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use division. If I take 96 and divide it by something to get it down. Let's see, 96 divided by 2 is 48, but I don't have a 2. However, I have a 1, so maybe 96 divided by (something involving 1). Alternatively, maybe 96 divided by (49 - something). Wait, 49 minus 1 is 48, so 96 divided by 48 is 2. That's interesting. So 96/(49-1) = 2. Then maybe I can use 72 somehow with that 2.\n\nSo, 72 divided by 2 is 36. Oh! So if I can get 2 from 96/(49-1), then 72 divided by that would be 36. Let me write that down:\n\n72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) = 36.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation step by step. First, 49 minus 1 is 48. Then, 96 divided by 48 is 2. Then, 72 divided by 2 is indeed 36. So that works.\n\nLet me make sure I used all the numbers: 49, 1, 96, 72. Yes, each is used once. The operations are division and subtraction, and I have parentheses to control the order. So that seems to fit all the rules.\n\nI think that's the solution. Let me just write it out properly with parentheses to ensure the order is correct.\n\nSUMMARY:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.05, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

That's still larger than 20, but maybe I can combine that with the other numbers.\n\nWait, 89 - 60 = 29. Then, if I subtract 32 from that, I get 29 - 32 = -3, which isn't helpful. Maybe instead, I can combine 89 and 32 somehow. 89 + 32 is 121, which is way too big. 89 - 32 is 57, still too big.\n\nWhat if I divide? 89 divided by something. If I take 89 / 19, that's approximately 4.68. Hmm, not sure if that helps. If I take 60 / 32, that's about 1.875. Maybe I can combine these fractions somehow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at the smaller numbers first. 19 and 32. If I subtract 19 from 32, I get 13. Then, if I can somehow combine that with 60 and 89 to get 20. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can use multiplication and division to balance things out. Let's see: If I take 60 divided by something, maybe 60 / (89 - 32) = 60 / 57 ≈ 1.05. That's too small. Then, if I add 19, I get around 20.05, which is close to 20. But let's check if that works with the exact numbers.\n\nSo, 89 - 32 = 57. Then, 60 / 57 is approximately 1.0526. Adding 19 gives roughly 20.0526. That's very close, but I need it to be exactly 20. Maybe there's a way to adjust the operations.\n\nWait, perhaps if I rearrange the operations. Instead of 60 / (89 - 32), maybe (60 - 19) / (89 - 32). Let's calculate that: 60 - 19 = 41, and 89 - 32 = 57. So, 41 / 57 ≈ 0.719. That's too small.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (60 - 89) / (32 - 19). Let's see: 60 - 89 = -29, and 32 - 19 = 13. So, -29 / 13 ≈ -2.23. Not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let's see if I can get 20 by combining three numbers first and then see how to include the fourth.\n\nFor example, 60 - 89 = -29. If I then add 32, I get 3. Then, 3 + 19 = 22. Close, but not 20.\n\nWait, what if I do (60 - 89) + (32 / 19). Let's calculate that: 60 - 89 = -29, and 32 / 19 ≈ 1.684. So, -29 + 1.684 ≈ -27.316. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (89 - 60) = 29. Then, 29 - 32 = -3. Then, -3 + 19 = 16. Not 20.\n\nWhat if I multiply some numbers? Like (89 - 60) * (32 / 19). Let's see: 89 - 60 = 29, 32 / 19 ≈ 1.684. So, 29 * 1.684 ≈ 49. That's too big.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to use division differently. Let's try (89 + 19) / (60 / 32). So, 89 + 19 = 108, and 60 / 32 = 1.875. Then, 108 / 1.875 = 57.6. That's too big.\n\nWait, what if I do (60 - 19) / (89 - 32). As I did earlier, that's 41 / 57 ≈ 0.719. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe I need to combine addition and subtraction differently. Let's try 89 - (60 + 32) = 89 - 92 = -3. Then, -3 + 19 = 16. Still not 20.\n\nAlternatively, 89 - (60 - 32) = 89 - 28 = 61. Then, 61 - 19 = 42. Nope.\n\nWait, maybe I can do something like (89 - 60) + (32 - 19). That's 29 + 13 = 42. Not 20.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to use multiplication. Let's see, 19 * (something) = 20. So, something would be 20 / 19 ≈ 1.05. How can I get that from the other numbers?\n\nIf I take 60 / (89 - 32) = 60 / 57 ≈ 1.0526, which is close to 1.05. Then, 19 * (60 / (89 - 32)) ≈ 19 * 1.0526 ≈ 20. That's exactly 20 if we ignore the decimal approximation. Let me check the exact calculation.\n\nSo, 89 - 32 = 57. Then, 60 / 57 = 20/19. So, 19 * (60 / 57) = (19 * 60) / 57. Let's compute that: 19 * 60 = 1140, and 1140 / 57 = 20. Yes! That works.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 19 * (60 / (89 - 32)) = 20.\n\nWait, let me check the numbers used: 19, 60, 89, 32. Each is used once. Operations: subtraction and division, with parentheses. That should satisfy all the rules.\n\nSo, the equation is 19 multiplied by (60 divided by (89 minus 32)) equals 20.\n\nSUMMARY:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.05, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The numbers given are 19, 60, 89, and 32, and I need to create an equation using all of them exactly once with the operations +, -, *, / and parentheses to make 20.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the numbers: 19, 60, 89, 32. I need to use each once. The target is 20, which is a relatively small number, so maybe I need to combine some larger numbers in a way that reduces them down.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 89 is the largest, and 60 is also quite big. 32 is medium, and 19 is the smallest. Since I need to get to 20, maybe I can use division to reduce some of these larger numbers.\n\nLet me think about possible operations. If I subtract 32 from 89, that gives me 57.

Yes, that works.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the equation is 19 multiplied by (60 divided by (89 minus 32)). Let me write that out properly with parentheses to ensure the order of operations is correct.\n\nSo, the equation would be 19 * (60 / (89 - 32)). Let me make sure all numbers are used once: 19, 60, 89, 32. Yes, each is used exactly once.

I have to use each number exactly once and can only use the operations +, -, *, and /. Also, I can use parentheses to control the order of operations. \n\nIn my previous attempt, I tried dividing 96 by (49 - 1), which gave me 2, and then I divided 72 by that result to get 36. The equation I came up with was 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) = 36. That seems to work, but I want to make sure I didn't miss any other possible solutions or if there's a simpler way to approach this.\n\nLet me go through my thought process again step by step. \n\nFirst, I'll list out the numbers: 49, 1, 96, 72. The target is 36. I need to use all four numbers with the operations provided.\n\nI remember that division can be tricky because it can create fractions, but sometimes it's necessary. So, maybe I should look for ways to combine numbers to get factors of 36 or numbers that can lead to 36 when operated on.\n\nLooking at 96, 72, and 49, I notice that 96 and 72 are both multiples of 24. 96 divided by 4 is 24, and 72 divided by 3 is 24. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAnother approach is to see if I can combine two numbers to get a useful intermediate result. For example, 49 - 1 is 48, which is a nice round number. Then, 96 divided by 48 is 2. That seems useful because then I can take 72 and divide it by 2 to get 36. So, putting it all together: 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) equals 36. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. \n\nFirst, calculate the denominator: 96 divided by (49 - 1) is 96 / 48, which is 2. Then, 72 divided by 2 is indeed 36. So that works. \n\nBut is there another way to arrange these numbers? Maybe using addition or subtraction differently. Let's see.\n\nIf I try adding some numbers first, like 49 + 1 = 50. Then I have 50, 96, and 72. I'm not sure how to get 36 from those. Maybe 96 - 72 = 24, and then 50 - 24 = 26, which isn't 36. Alternatively, 96 / 50 is about 1.92, which isn't helpful.\n\nWhat if I subtract 72 from 96? That gives me 24. Then, 49 - 1 = 48. Hmm, 24 and 48. Maybe 48 - 24 = 24, which doesn't help. Or 48 / 24 = 2, but then I'm back to the previous approach.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe multiply some numbers. 49 * 1 = 49. Then, 96 and 72. If I do 96 - 72 = 24, then 49 - 24 = 25, which isn't 36. Alternatively, 96 / 49 is about 1.959, which doesn't seem useful.\n\nWait, what if I do 96 / (49 - 1) first, which is 2, and then 72 / 2 = 36. That's the same as before. So, that seems consistent.\n\nIs there a way to use multiplication instead? Let's see. If I take 72 and divide it by something to get 36, that something has to be 2. So, how can I get 2 using 49, 1, and 96? Well, 96 divided by (49 - 1) is 2, as I did before. So that's the same solution.\n\nAlternatively, could I use addition or subtraction in a different way? Let's try. Suppose I take 49 - 1 = 48, then 96 - 48 = 48. Then, 72 - 48 = 24, which isn't 36. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 96 / (49 - 1) = 2, then 72 - 2 = 70, which isn't 36. No, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 49 - (96 / (72 / 1)). Let's see: 72 / 1 is 72, then 96 / 72 is 1.333, and 49 - 1.333 is about 47.666, which isn't 36.\n\nHmm, not helpful. Alternatively, 96 / (49 - (72 / 1)) = 96 / (49 - 72) = 96 / (-23) ≈ -4.17, which is not 36.\n\nSo that approach doesn't work. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe combine 49 and 72 somehow. 72 - 49 = 23, then 96 - 23 = 73, which isn't 36. Or 72 / 49 ≈ 1.469, then 96 - 1.469 ≈ 94.53, which isn't 36.\n\nAlternatively, 49 + 72 = 121, then 96 - 121 = -25, which isn't 36. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using multiplication. Let's see: 49 * 1 = 49. Then, 96 - 49 = 47, then 72 - 47 = 25, which isn't 36. Or 96 / 49 ≈ 1.959, then 72 * 1.959 ≈ 141, which isn't 36.\n\nAlternatively, 96 / (72 / (49 - 1)) = 96 / (72 / 48) = 96 / 1.5 = 64, which isn't 36.\n\nWait, that's not right. Let me recalculate. 72 / (49 - 1) is 72 / 48 = 1.5. Then 96 divided by that is 96 / 1.5 = 64, which is not 36. So that doesn't help.\n\nWait, but in my previous solution, I did 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) which is 72 / 2 = 36. So that works. \n\nIs there another way? Let's try using subtraction in the denominator. For example, 96 / (49 - 1) = 2, then 72 / 2 = 36. That's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 - (96 / (49 - 1)) = 72 - 2 = 70, which isn't 36.\n\nOr, 96 / (72 / (49 - 1)) = 96 / (72 / 48) = 96 / 1.5 = 64, which isn't 36.\n\nSo, it seems like the only way to get 36 is by using 72 divided by (96 divided by (49 - 1)), which simplifies to 72 / 2 = 36.\n\nI don't see another combination that uses all four numbers to reach 36. So, my initial solution seems to be correct.\n\nSUMMARY:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.05, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

I remember trying this before and coming up with 19 * (60 / (89 - 32)), which worked because 89 - 32 is 57, then 60 divided by 57 is roughly 1.0526, and multiplying that by 19 gives exactly 20. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So 89 minus 32 is indeed 57. Then 60 divided by 57 is 60/57, which simplifies to 20/19 when you divide numerator and denominator by 3. So 19 times (20/19) is 20. Yep, that's correct. So that equation works.\n\nBut the user is asking if this approach is correct. I think it is because each number is used exactly once, and the operations are all allowed. The parentheses are correctly placed to change the order of operations. \n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe, but since I already have a working solution, I don't need to complicate things. However, just to explore, I could try other combinations. For example, could I use addition or subtraction in a different way? Let's see.\n\nIf I try adding some numbers, maybe 60 + 19 is 79, and then see if 89 - 32 is 57, but then how would I combine 79 and 57 to get 20? That seems unlikely because 79 is much larger than 57, and 79 - 57 is 22, which is close but not 20. Alternatively, 79 divided by 57 is about 1.38, which doesn't help.\n\nWhat if I subtract first? 89 - 60 is 29, then 32 - 19 is 13. Then maybe 29 and 13, but I don't see how to get 20 from those. Alternatively, 89 - 32 is 57, which I already used, and then 60 - 19 is 41. 57 and 41 don't combine easily to 20.\n\nMultiplication might not help directly because 19 times 32 is already 608, which is way too big. Similarly, 60 times anything would overshoot. Division might be the key here because it can reduce larger numbers.\n\nAnother thought: 60 divided by something. If I can get 3 from the other numbers, then 60 / 3 is 20. How can I get 3? Let's see. 89 - 32 is 57, which is not 3. 19 minus something? 19 - (89 - 32) is 19 -57, which is negative. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe using division differently. What if I do 60 / (89 - 32) first, which is 60/57, and then multiply by 19. That's exactly what I did before, so that's the same solution.\n\nAlternatively, could I do something like (60 - 19) / (89 - 32)? That would be 41 / 57, which is less than 1, so that's not 20.\n\nWhat if I use addition in the denominator? Like 60 / (89 - 32 + 19)? Wait, 89 -32 is 57, plus 19 is 76. So 60 /76 is about 0.789, and then multiplying by something else... but I only have 32 left, which is too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 89 - (60 / (19 + 32)). Let's see: 19 +32 is 51, 60 /51 is about 1.176, then 89 -1.176 is about 87.824, which is not 20.\n\nHmm, seems like the initial approach is the most straightforward and effective. It uses each number once, follows the order of operations with parentheses, and correctly arrives at 20. I don't see a simpler or more accurate way to do this, so I think the answer is correct.\n\nSUMMARY:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.05, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nSummarize the following attempted solution to the problem:\n\nPROBLEM:\nUsing all numbers from [49, 1, 96, 72], create an equation that equals 36.\n\nRules:\n- You must use every single number in your answer and each number can only be used once (i.e. if input numbers are [1, 2, 3, 4], then your answer must be composed of 1,2,3,4 where each number only appears once.)\n- Available operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/)\n- Use parentheses to control order of operations\n\n- For each list of input numbers, and a given target number, you are guaranteed that there exists a valid solution using the given rules.\n\nReturn your final equation in <answer> </answer> tags, for example if your answer is (1 + 2) * 3 - 4, then return <answer> (1 + 2) * 3 - 4 </answer>.\n\n\n\nATTEMPTED SOLUTION:\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to use the numbers 49, 1, 96, and 72 to create an equation that equals 36. I have to use each number exactly once and can only use the operations +, -, *, and /. Also, I can use parentheses to control the order of operations. The previous attempts came up with the equation 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) = 36, which seems to work. But I should check if there are other possible solutions or if this is the only way.\n\nLet me start by understanding why the previous solution works. So, breaking it down step by step:\n\n1. First, calculate the innermost parentheses: 49 - 1 = 48.\n2. Then, divide 96 by that result: 96 / 48 = 2.\n3. Finally, divide 72 by 2: 72 / 2 = 36.\n\nThat makes sense. But maybe I can try a different approach to see if there's another way to reach 36.\n\nLet me consider all possible operations and combinations. Since 36 is a relatively small number compared to the given numbers, perhaps division is necessary. Looking at the numbers, 96 is the largest, so maybe dividing it by something could give a useful intermediate value.\n\nIf I take 96 and divide it by another number, say 96 / something. Let me see:\n\n- 96 / 49 is roughly 1.959, which isn't very helpful.\n- 96 / 1 is 96, which is too big.\n- 96 / 72 is 1.333, which also doesn't seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtracting 49 and 1 first, as in the previous solution, gives 48, which when divided into 96 gives 2. Then using 72 / 2 is 36. That seems efficient.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe using addition or subtraction with 49 and 1 first. For example, 49 + 1 = 50, but then how to use that with 96 and 72. Maybe 96 - 50 = 46, but then 72 and 46 don't combine easily to 36. Or 96 + 50 = 146, which seems too big.\n\nWhat if I try multiplying 49 and 1? 49 * 1 = 49, which doesn't help much. 49 - 1 = 48, which we already used.\n\nWhat if I try to combine 72 and 96 first? 72 + 96 = 168, which is too big. 72 - 96 = -24, which might not be useful. 72 * 96 is way too big, and 72 / 96 is 0.75, which is small.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using 72 and 49. 72 + 49 = 121, too big. 72 - 49 = 23. 72 * 49 is huge, and 72 / 49 is about 1.469.\n\nWait, maybe combining 72 with the result of another operation. For example, if I can get 2 from 96, 49, and 1, then 72 / 2 = 36. That's exactly what the previous solution did.\n\nAnother angle: Let's see if using multiplication somewhere else can help. For example, 49 * (something) = 36. But 36 is less than 49, so maybe 49 - something. But 49 - 1 = 48, as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 96 / (something) = 2, then 72 / 2 = 36. So, 96 divided by (49 -1) is 2, which is the same as before.\n\nIs there another way to get 2 from 96, 49, and 1? Let's see: 96 / (49 - 1) = 2, which is the same as before. Alternatively, 96 / (something else). Maybe 96 / (96 / something). Wait, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 96 - (49 + 1) = 46, which doesn't help. 96 - 49 = 47, which isn't helpful either.\n\nAnother thought: What if I use 72 in a different way. For example, 72 / (something) = 36. So, something needs to be 2. So, how to get 2 from 96, 49, and 1. Again, 96 / (49 -1) = 2. So, that's the same path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using subtraction in a different way. For example, 96 - 72 = 24. Then, 49 - 1 = 48. Then, 24 and 48. Hmm, 24 + 48 = 72, which isn't helpful. 24 * 48 is too big. 24 / 48 = 0.5, which isn't useful. 48 - 24 = 24, still not 36.\n\nWhat if I do 96 / (49 - 1) = 2, then 72 - 2 = 70, which isn't 36. Or 72 + 2 = 74. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using multiplication before division. For example, (96 / (49 -1)) * something. But that would give a larger number, which doesn't help reach 36.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to see if combining 72 and 96 in a different way can lead to a useful intermediate number. For example, 72 + 96 = 168. Then, 168 divided by something. But 168 / 49 is about 3.428, which isn't helpful. 168 / (49 -1) = 168 /48=3.5, which still doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, 72 * (something) = 36. So, something needs to be 0.5. How to get 0.5 from 96,49,1. Maybe 96 / (49 +1) = 96/50=1.92, which is close but not 0.5. Or 49 - 1 =48, then 96 /48=2, which again leads to the previous solution.\n\nWait, maybe 96 / (49 + 1) = 1.92, which isn't 0.5. Alternatively, (96 / 49) /1 ≈1.959, still not 0.5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using subtraction in a different order. For example, 49 - (something) = something. But I think the previous approach is the most straightforward.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe using addition and subtraction together. For example, 96 - (49 +1) = 46, then 72 -46=26, which isn't 36. Or 96 - (49 -1)=48, then 72 -48=24, not 36.\n\nWait, but 72 - (96 - (49 -1)) =72 -48=24, still not 36.\n\nAlternatively, 72 + (96 - (49 -1))=72 +48=120, which is too big.\n\nHmm, maybe trying to use multiplication. Let's see: 49 *1=49, then 96 -49=47, then 72 -47=25, not 36.\n\nAlternatively, 49 +1=50, 96 -50=46, 72 -46=26, not 36.\n\nAlternatively, 49 * (96 / something). Let's see: 96 /49≈1.959, then 49*1.959≈96, which doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, 72 / (something) =36, which requires something=2, which we can get from 96/(49-1)=2. So, that's the same as before.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. The previous solution seems solid because it efficiently uses division to get a small number, which when used with 72 gives 36. I don't see another way to combine these numbers to get 36 without repeating the same steps.\n\nAnother check: Let's verify the order of operations. In the equation 72 / (96 / (49 -1)), the innermost parentheses are calculated first: 49-1=48. Then, 96/48=2. Finally, 72/2=36. That's correct.\n\nIs there a way to write this equation differently but still get the same result? For example, using more parentheses or rearranging the operations. Let's see:\n\n- 72 / ((96 / (49 -1))) is the same as before.\n- Alternatively, (72 / 96) * (49 -1) = (0.75) *48=36. Oh, wait, that's another way!\n\nSo, (72 / 96) * (49 -1) = (0.75) *48=36. That's a different arrangement but still uses all numbers once. Let me check:\n\n- 49 -1=48\n- 72 /96=0.75\n- 0.75 *48=36\n\nYes, that works too. So, another possible equation is (72 / 96) * (49 -1) =36.\n\nBut wait, does that use all numbers? 72,96,49,1. Yes, each is used once. So that's another valid solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe writing it as (72 * (49 -1)) /96=36. Let's see:\n\n- 49-1=48\n- 72*48=3456\n- 3456 /96=36\n\nYes, that's another valid equation. So, there are multiple ways to arrange the operations to reach 36.\n\nBut the initial solution was 72 / (96 / (49 -1))=36, which is also correct.\n\nSo, the problem allows any valid equation, so both are correct. But since the previous attempt found one solution, and I found another, perhaps the user is looking for the first one, but both are valid.\n\nIn conclusion, the most straightforward solution is the one previously found, but there are alternative valid equations as well.\n\nSUMMARY:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.05, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

I remember from previous attempts that one solution was 19 multiplied by (60 divided by (89 minus 32)). Let me double-check that to make sure it's correct.\n\nFirst, let's compute the subtraction inside the parentheses: 89 minus 32. That's 57. Then, we take 60 and divide it by 57. 60 divided by 57 is approximately 1.0526. Finally, we multiply 19 by that result. So, 19 times 1.0526 is roughly 20. That seems to work.\n\nBut wait, I should verify the exact calculation to be precise. Let's do it step by step without approximating. 60 divided by (89 minus 32) is 60/57, which simplifies to 20/19 because both numerator and denominator can be divided by 3. So, 60/57 = 20/19. Then, 19 multiplied by (20/19) is exactly 20 because the 19s cancel out. That's a neat trick and shows that the equation is exact, not just approximate.\n\nI also want to make sure that all numbers are used exactly once. In this equation, 19 is used, 60 is used, 89 is used, and 32 is used. Each appears only once, so that fits the rules.\n\nAre there other ways to approach this? Let me think. Maybe using addition or subtraction in a different way. For example, could I combine 60 and 89 somehow? Let's see, 60 minus 32 is 28, but then I'm left with 19 and 89. Maybe 89 divided by something? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, 60 divided by 3 is 20, but I don't have a 3. Wait, 32 minus 19 is 13, but that doesn't directly help.\n\nAnother thought: what if I subtract 32 from 60? That's 28. Then maybe 89 minus 28 is 61, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, 89 minus 60 is 29, and 32 minus 19 is 13. Not sure how that helps.\n\nWhat if I try adding some numbers? 19 plus 32 is 51, and 60 plus 89 is 149. Not useful. Alternatively, 19 plus 60 is 79, and 89 minus 32 is 57. Still not helpful.\n\nMaybe multiplication: 19 times 32 is 608, which is way too big. 60 times 89 is 5340, way too big. So probably not using multiplication on larger numbers.\n\nAlternatively, could I use division in a different way? For example, (89 - 32) is 57, as before. Then 60 divided by 57 is about 1.0526. Then 19 times that is 20. That's the same as before.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps using addition in the denominator. Like 89 - (32 + something). But 32 + 19 is 51, so 89 - 51 is 38. Then 60 divided by 38 is about 1.5789. Then 19 times that is about 30, which is too big.\n\nAlternatively, 89 - (60 - 32) is 89 - 28 = 61. Then 60 divided by 61 is about 0.9836. 19 times that is about 18.7, which is close but not 20.\n\nHmm, maybe using fractions differently. For example, (60 / (89 - 32)) * 19. That's the same as before. Alternatively, 60 / (89 - (32 / 19)). Wait, 32 divided by 19 is about 1.684. So 89 - 1.684 is about 87.316. Then 60 divided by 87.316 is about 0.687. Then 19 times that is about 13, which is too low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (60 + 89) divided by (32 - 19). 60 + 89 is 149, and 32 - 19 is 13. So 149 divided by 13 is about 11.46, which is not 20.\n\nWait, that's an interesting approach. Let me see: (60 + 89) / (32 - 19) = 149 / 13 ≈ 11.46. Not 20. But maybe if I adjust the operations.\n\nWhat if I do (60 * 89) / (32 + 19). 60*89 is 5340, and 32+19 is 51. 5340 / 51 is 104.705, which is way too big.\n\nAlternatively, (60 - 32) * (89 - 19). 60-32=28, 89-19=70. 28*70=1960. Nope, way too big.\n\nAlternatively, (60 / 32) + (89 - 19). 60/32 is 1.875, and 89-19=70. 1.875 +70=71.875. Not 20.\n\nHmm, maybe using subtraction differently. Let's try 89 - (60 / (32 / 19)). Wait, 32 divided by 19 is about 1.684. Then 60 divided by that is about 35.7. Then 89 - 35.7 is about 53.3. Not 20.\n\nAlternatively, (89 - 60) / (32 / 19). 89-60=29, 32/19≈1.684. 29 / 1.684≈17.2. Not 20.\n\nWait, another idea: 19 + (60 - 89) + 32. That would be 19 -29 +32=22. Close but not 20.\n\nAlternatively, 19 + (60 - 89 +32). 60-89= -29, +32=3. 19+3=22. Still not 20.\n\nAlternatively, 19 + (60 - (89 -32)). 89-32=57, 60-57=3. 19+3=22.\n\nHmm, same result. Maybe subtraction: 60 - (89 -32) -19. 89-32=57, 60-57=3, 3-19=-16. Not 20.\n\nAlternatively, (60 - 19) + (89 -32). 60-19=41, 89-32=57. 41+57=98. Not 20.\n\nWait, maybe using division with 19. For example, (60 / 19) + (89 -32). 60/19≈3.157, 89-32=57. 3.157+57≈60.157. Not 20.\n\nAlternatively, (89 - 60) + (32 /19). 89-60=29, 32/19≈1.684. 29+1.684≈30.684. Not 20.\n\nHmm, maybe I should stick with the initial solution. It worked perfectly without any approximations because the fractions simplified nicely. Let me just recap:\n\nThe equation is 19 * (60 / (89 - 32)).\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. Compute the subtraction in the denominator: 89 -32=57.\n2. Divide 60 by 57: 60/57=20/19.\n3. Multiply 19 by (20/19): 19*(20/19)=20.\n\nThat's exact and uses all numbers once. I think that's the correct solution. I don't see any errors in this approach, and all previous attempts to find alternative solutions either didn't work or were more complicated. So, I'm confident that this is the right answer.\n\nSUMMARY:\n<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.05, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.
