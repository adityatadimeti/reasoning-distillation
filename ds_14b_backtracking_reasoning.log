To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

Initially, the solver considered subtraction to reduce larger numbers to smaller values and tried several approaches involving division and addition/subtraction sequences. However, these initial attempts did not yield the correct result due to incorrect grouping and operation choices.\n\nThe solver then changed strategy by focusing on creating fractions that could result in the target value. They realized that by subtracting 1 from 22 and 31 from 38, they could form two numbers, 21 and 7 respectively. Recognizing that 21 divided by 7 equals 3, the solver reversed their initial attempt of dividing 7 by 21, opting instead for (22 - 1) / (38 - 31). This adjustment led to the correct solution.\n\nUpon double-checking the arithmetic, the solver confirmed that (22 - 1) / (38 - 31) does indeed equal 3, validating the solution. Therefore, the final equation provided was <answer>(22 - 1) / (38 - 31)</answer>.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nIn the attempted solution, the model initially approached the problem by focusing on reducing the larger numbers through subtraction. The initial strategy involved subtracting smaller numbers from larger ones to simplify the arithmetic. Specifically, the model started by subtracting 31 from 38, resulting in 7, and then subtracted 1 from 22, resulting in 21.\n\nUpon realizing that dividing 21 by 7 yields 3, the model adjusted its strategy to incorporate these results into a valid equation. This led to the formulation of the equation (22 - 1)/(38 - 31). The model then verified the correctness of this equation by rechecking the arithmetic steps:\n\n1. 22 - 1 = 21\n2. 38 - 31 = 7\n3. 21 / 7 = 3\n\nThe model did not backtrack but rather confirmed the solution was correct after formulating it. Throughout the process, the model ensured that all four numbers (31, 38, 22, and 1) were used exactly once and that the operations and parentheses adhered to the given rules. The solution was deemed satisfactory and no further revisions were necessary.\n\nFinal equation provided: <answer>(22 - 1)/(38 - 31)</answer>.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nIn attempting to solve the problem of creating an equation that equals 3 using the numbers [31, 38, 1, 22] exactly once, the model initially considered the necessity of employing division due to the small target number. It began by identifying potential pairs of numbers that could yield simpler results when subjected to basic arithmetic operations. \n\nThe model first tried subtracting the smallest numbers from the largest numbers: \n- Calculating \\(38 - 31\\) yielded \\(7\\).\n- Then, calculating \\(22 - 1\\) resulted in \\(21\\).\n\nUpon realizing that dividing \\(21\\) by \\(7\\) directly yields \\(3\\), the model assembled these steps into the final equation:\n\\[ \\frac{22 - 1}{38 - 31} = \\frac{21}{7} = 3 \\]\n\nThroughout this process, the model did not need to backtrack or revise any decisions, as each step logically led to the next until arriving at a valid solution. Thus, the solution was reached efficiently without changing strategies mid-way. The final equation that satisfies the conditions is:\n<answer> (22 - 1) / (38 - 31) </answer>.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nIn the attempted solution, the model initially focused on achieving the target number 3 through the strategic use of division due to the presence of large numbers (31 and 38) and smaller numbers (1 and 22). The initial approach was to simplify the larger numbers by subtracting the smaller ones from them:\n\n1. Subtracting 31 from 38 yields 7.\n2. Subtracting 1 from 22 yields 21.\n\nThe model then recognized that dividing 21 by 7 would result in the desired output of 3. This realization led to constructing the equation as follows: (22 - 1) / (38 - 31).\n\nThroughout the process, the model did not change its strategy but rather validated its approach by performing simple arithmetic checks. It ensured that each number was used exactly once and that the operations were correctly applied. There were no explicit revisions or backtracks since the initial strategy proved effective without encountering obstacles that required adjustments.\n\nThus, the final solution provided is confidently deemed correct: <answer>(22 - 1) / (38 - 31)</answer>.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\n', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=27000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

It noted that (95 - 89) yields 6 and (47 - 24) yields 23. Realizing that 23 - 6 equals 17, the model proposed the equation (47 - 24) - (95 - 89) = 17.

Initially, the solver considered subtraction and division to reduce larger numbers, such as subtracting 34 from 76 to get 42, and then trying to find ways to add 4 using the remaining numbers 58 and 6. However, this initial attempt did not yield the correct result due to the infeasibility of reducing 58 or 6 to a useful value directly.\n\nSubsequently, the solver experimented with different groupings and operations, including combining addition and subtraction in various orders and positions, as well as attempting multiplication and division. These attempts included calculations like (76 - 34) + (58 / 6) and (76 / 34) * (58 - 6), but none of them produced the desired outcome of 46.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful trials, the solver revisited the idea of using subtraction and addition strategically. They found a working combination: 34 + (76 - 58) - 6. This equation breaks down as follows: 76 - 58 yields 18, adding 34 to 18 results in 52, and finally, subtracting 6 from 52 reaches the target value of 46.\n\nUpon verifying that all numbers were used exactly once and confirming the correctness of the operations and order, the solver concluded that the equation 34 + (76 - 58) - 6 was indeed a valid solution to the problem.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution began by exploring various combinations of the numbers 76, 34, 58, and 6, aiming to achieve the target number 46. Initially, the solver attempted to use subtraction and division but found these operations did not yield the desired result. For instance, subtracting 34 from 76 got close to the target but required further adjustments that were not feasible with the remaining numbers. Similarly, other combinations involving division and multiplication also fell short of the target.\n\nRecognizing the limitations of the initial strategies, the solver decided to pivot towards a different approach. Instead of focusing solely on subtraction and division, they experimented with addition and subtraction in various orders. This led to the combination 34 + (76 - 58) - 6, which simplified as follows: \n- First, 76 - 58 = 18.\n- Then, 34 + 18 = 52.\n- Finally, 52 - 6 = 46.\n\nThis sequence successfully reached the target number while adhering to the requirement of using each number exactly once. After confirming the correct usage of numbers and verifying the operations and parentheses placement, the solver concluded that the equation 34 + (76 - 58) - 6 is a valid solution.\n\nThe summary highlights the solver's strategic shift from complex operations to simpler arithmetic manipulations, leading to the successful creation of the equation that meets the problem's criteria.\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nIn the attempted solution, the model started by analyzing the target number (46) and the available numbers (76, 34, 58, and 6). Recognizing that 46 is relatively small compared to the larger numbers provided (76 and 58), the model initially decided to focus on reducing those large numbers through subtraction. \n\nThe model first tried subtracting 58 from 76, resulting in 18. With the remaining numbers (34 and 6), the model then aimed to reach 46 by combining the results. By adding 34 to 18, they got 52. Finally, subtracting 6 from 52 yielded the desired result of 46. This sequence led to the proposed equation: 34 + (76 - 58) - 6.\n\nThroughout this process, no explicit backtracking or revising of decisions occurred since the initial strategy worked successfully. The model double-checked the correctness of their equation, ensuring each number was used exactly once and verifying the order of operations with parentheses. \n\nThe model concluded confidently that the equation met all the problem's requirements without needing to alter or refine their strategy further. Thus, the final solution presented is considered correct based on the initial approach taken.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nIn attempting to solve the problem of creating an equation equal to 46 using the numbers 76, 34, 58, and 6, the model initially focused on reducing the largest number, 76, by subtracting 58 from it, resulting in 18. The model then planned to reach the target by adding 34 to 18 and subsequently subtracting 6. This led to the equation 34 + (76 - 58) - 6.\n\nThroughout the process, no explicit change in strategy or backtracking was mentioned; however, the initial approach of reducing the largest number first can be seen as a strategic decision that led directly to a successful solution without requiring adjustments. The model did not encounter any obstacles that necessitated revising previous decisions or backtracking from earlier steps. Thus, the proposed solution was straightforward and effective from the beginning, adhering strictly to the problem's constraints and achieving the target value of 46.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

This led to exploring possible combinations with the remaining numbers (58, 14, and 43) to obtain the number 2. The initial approach involved simple subtraction and division operations.\n\nThe model first tried direct subtraction but found it ineffective. It then shifted to division, aiming to divide 58 by a value derived from 14 and 43. Realizing that 43 minus 14 equals 29, the model used this to divide 58 by 29, resulting in 2. This strategic shift from subtraction to division was pivotal, as it enabled the formation of a viable equation.\n\nAfter obtaining 2 through the division operation, the model then subtracted this result from 78, yielding the desired outcome of 76. The model ensured that each number was used exactly once and verified the correctness of the equation by breaking down the operations step-by-step: first, 43 minus 14 equals 29; second, 58 divided by 29 equals 2; finally, 78 minus 2 equals 76.\n\nThroughout the process, the model demonstrated flexibility in adjusting its approach from simple subtraction to incorporating division, showcasing a clear change in strategy and validation of intermediate steps. The final equation confirmed as correct is: <answer>78 - (58 / (43 - 14))</answer>.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

Initially, the solver focused on finding ways to reduce the larger numbers (81 and 71) to smaller values through subtraction or division, aiming to reach a target of 3 through further operations. When direct subtraction or division didn't yield immediate success, the solver explored multiplying or dividing pairs of numbers to create intermediate values that could lead to the target.\n\nThroughout the process, the solver frequently adjusted strategies based on the outcomes of initial attempts. For example, after realizing that direct division or subtraction alone wouldn't suffice, the solver considered combining operations, such as using subtraction to create a divisor that could produce the target value when applied to another number. However, this often led to intermediate results that were either too large or too small, necessitating frequent backtracking and reconsideration.\n\nA significant change in strategy occurred when the solver recognized the potential of creating an intermediate value of 9 through the operation `71 - 62`, which could then be used in conjunction with another number to reach the target. This led to attempts like `(81 / (30 - 9))` or `(81 / (30 - (71 - 62)))`, where the focus shifted towards manipulating the numbers to create the necessary divisors or numerators.\n\nHowever, several calculations and assumptions were incorrect, leading to dead ends or requiring corrections. A pivotal moment came when the solver correctly identified `(81 - (71 - 62)) / 30 = 3`, which involved a careful adjustment of parentheses to ensure all numbers were used precisely once. After verifying the correct sequence and recalculating, the solver confirmed the validity of the equation `(81 - (71 - 62)) / 30`.\n\nIn summary, the solver's approach evolved from simple operations to more complex combinations, involving frequent revisions and adjustments until arriving at a successful equation that met the problem's requirements.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

This led to exploring possible combinations with the remaining numbers (58, 14, and 43) to obtain the number 2. The initial approach involved simple subtraction and division operations.\n\nThe model first tried direct subtraction but found it ineffective. It then shifted to division, aiming to divide 58 by a value derived from 14 and 43. Realizing that 43 minus 14 equals 29, the model used this to divide 58 by 29, resulting in 2. This strategic shift from subtraction to division was pivotal, as it enabled the formation of a viable equation.\n\nAfter obtaining 2 through the division operation, the model then subtracted this result from 78, yielding the desired outcome of 76. The model ensured that each number was used exactly once and verified the correctness of the equation by breaking down the operations step-by-step: first, 43 minus 14 equals 29; second, 58 divided by 29 equals 2; finally, 78 minus 2 equals 76.\n\nThroughout the process, the model demonstrated flexibility in adjusting its approach from simple subtraction to incorporating division, showcasing a clear change in strategy and validation of intermediate steps.

This insight led to the strategy of aiming to subtract 2 from 78. Consequently, the focus shifted to finding a way to use the remaining numbers (58, 14, and 43) to achieve 2.\n\nThe model explored different operations and realized that subtraction could be useful. By calculating 43 - 14, the model obtained 29. Recognizing that dividing 58 by 29 yields 2, the model formulated the expression 58 / (43 - 14) to produce the required 2.\n\nUpon validating this sub-expression, the model incorporated it into the main equation as 78 - (58 / (43 - 14)). Evaluating this step-by-step confirmed its correctness:\n\n1. Calculated the inner subtraction: 43 - 14 = 29.\n2. Performed the division: 58 / 29 = 2.\n3.

Initially, the model explored subtracting combinations of the smaller numbers (51, 48, and 5) to reach 8, but found early attempts unfruitful. Specifically, it tried subtracting 48 from 51, resulting in 3, and further subtracting this from 5, which did not yield 8.\n\nUpon realizing the initial approach wasn't working, the model changed its strategy. It revisited the combination of the smaller numbers and tried a new approach: calculating 51 minus (48 minus 5). This calculation proved successful, as it yielded 8. Recognizing this breakthrough, the model then constructed the full equation by subtracting the newly derived 8 from 89, leading to the final equation: 89 - (51 - (48 - 5)).\n\nThe model double-checked the solution by verifying each step of the calculation and ensuring all numbers were used exactly once, confirming the correctness of the equation.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

This insight leads to the proposed equation \\(89 - (51 - (48 - 5))\\).\n\nDuring the process, there was a momentary confusion when calculating \\(51 - (48 - 5)\\), where the solver briefly considered an incorrect sequence of operations before correctly identifying that \\(51 - 43\\) equals 8.\n\nUpon confirming that the equation \\(89 - (51 - (48 - 5))\\) correctly utilizes all the required numbers and adheres to the specified operations, the solver concludes that the equation is valid and meets the problem's requirements.\n\nIn summary, the solver initially aimed to reduce 89 by 8, explored different combinations to achieve the necessary intermediate value, corrected a minor calculation mistake, and ultimately arrived at the correct solution \\(<answer>89 - (51 - (48 - 5))</answer>\\).\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe model began by analyzing the numbers provided—89, 5, 48, and 51—and identified that the target number, 81, was very close to the largest number, 89, suggesting that subtraction might be useful. Initially, the model explored subtracting combinations of the smaller numbers (51, 48, and 5) to reach 8, but found early attempts unfruitful. Specifically, it tried subtracting 48 from 51, resulting in 3, and further subtracting this from 5, which did not yield 8.\n\nUpon realizing the initial approach wasn't working, the model changed its strategy. It revisited the combination of the smaller numbers and tried a new approach: calculating 51 minus (48 minus 5). This calculation proved successful, as it yielded 8. Recognizing this breakthrough, the model then constructed the full equation by subtracting the newly derived 8 from 89, leading to the final equation: 89 - (51 - (48 - 5)).\n\nThe model double-checked the solution by verifying each step of the calculation and ensuring all numbers were used exactly once, confirming the correctness of the equation.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nIn attempting to solve the problem of creating an equation that equals 81 using the numbers 89, 5, 48, and 51, the model initially focused on the closeness of 89 to 81 and decided to subtract a value from 89 to reach the target. This led to identifying the need to form the number 8 using the remaining numbers 5, 48, and 51.\n\nThe initial attempt involved subtracting 48 from 51 to get 3, and then trying to manipulate 5 and 3 to achieve 8, but this did not yield the desired result. The model then changed its strategy by rearranging the operations: subtracting 5 from 48 to get 43, and then subtracting this result from 51 to obtain 8. This new approach was successful in forming the required sub-expression.\n\nThe model then combined this sub-expression into the main equation: \\(89 - (51 - (48 - 5))\\). By evaluating the equation step-by-step, it confirmed that the operations were correctly ordered and that the target value of 81 was achieved.\n\nThroughout the process, the model demonstrated adaptability by revising its approach when the first attempt did not succeed and by ensuring that all given numbers were utilized exactly once according to the problem's rules. No further exploration of alternative combinations was deemed necessary due to the successful formation and verification of the equation.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=27000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

Initially, the solver considered subtracting from the largest number, 92, to reach 59, leading to the identification that 33 needs to be derived from the remaining numbers. However, this initial approach did not yield the required intermediate value of 33 directly, prompting a reevaluation.\n\nSubsequently, the solver explored combining 40 and 50 through various operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, but none produced a viable intermediate step. The solver then shifted focus to potential combinations involving 23 and 92, concluding that direct subtraction was not productive without further manipulation.\n\nA pivotal change in strategy occurred when the solver recognized that combining two numbers to produce an intermediate value suitable for subtraction from 92 could work. Specifically, considering \\(50 - 40 = 10\\), the solver identified that \\(92 - 10 = 82\\) and \\(82 - 23 = 59\\), meeting the target. This realization led to the equation \\(92 - (50 - 40) - 23 = 59\\).\n\nThroughout the process, the solver acknowledged the importance of using parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations, verifying each step carefully. The final verification confirmed the correctness of the equation, ensuring all numbers were used precisely once and the order of operations was properly managed.\n\nIn summary, the solver initially explored straightforward subtraction and combination strategies before shifting to a more complex but effective approach, ultimately arriving at the correct equation: \\((92 - (50 - 40)) - 23 = 59\\).\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

This equation is also confirmed correct and noted for its simplicity due to the absence of parentheses.\n\nAfter validating each solution, the solver considered whether a more optimal or alternative solution could exist, particularly one involving multiplication or division. However, since the problem only required using the numbers exactly once and any combination of operations, the third solution was deemed the most straightforward and optimal due to its simplicity and readability.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe solver concluded that the simplest and most direct solution is the third equation: 92 + 40 - 50 - 23 = 59. Thus, the final answer is presented as:\n<answer> 92 + 40 - 50 - 23 </answer>.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.

However, since the problem only required using the numbers exactly once and any combination of operations, the third solution was deemed the most straightforward and optimal due to its simplicity and readability.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe solver concluded that the simplest and most direct solution is the third equation: 92 + 40 - 50 - 23 = 59. Thus, the final answer is presented as:\n<answer> 92 + 40 - 50 - 23 </answer>.\n\nATTEMPT 3 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution initially considered several approaches to solve the equation using the numbers 40, 50, 23, and 92 to equal 59. The solver started by verifying a previously identified equation, \\(92 + 40 - 50 - 23 = 59\\), which was confirmed to be correct through step-by-step calculation. This equation was straightforward and did not require nested parentheses.\n\nThe solver then explored alternative methods involving multiplication and division but found them unhelpful due to the resulting values being either too large or too small to contribute effectively towards the target of 59. Another combination, \\((92 - 50) + (40 - 23) = 59\\), was discovered to be valid but was deemed less optimal due to its use of nested parentheses compared to the simpler equation.\n\nAfter re-evaluating the simpler equation \\(92 + 40 - 50 - 23 = 59\\) and confirming its correctness, the solver concluded that it was indeed the most efficient solution. The final answer provided was:\n\n<answer>92 + 40 - 50 - 23</answer>\n\nThroughout the process, the solver demonstrated flexibility by exploring different strategies and revisiting simpler solutions after considering more complex ones, ultimately converging on the most straightforward and effective equation.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=27000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

Initially, the solver focused on finding ways to reduce the larger numbers (81 and 71) to smaller values through subtraction or division, aiming to reach a target of 3 through further operations. When direct subtraction or division didn't yield immediate success, the solver explored multiplying or dividing pairs of numbers to create intermediate values that could lead to the target.\n\nThroughout the process, the solver frequently adjusted strategies based on the outcomes of initial attempts. For example, after realizing that direct division or subtraction alone wouldn't suffice, the solver considered combining operations, such as using subtraction to create a divisor that could produce the target value when applied to another number. However, this often led to intermediate results that were either too large or too small, necessitating frequent backtracking and reconsideration.\n\nA significant change in strategy occurred when the solver recognized the potential of creating an intermediate value of 9 through the operation `71 - 62`, which could then be used in conjunction with another number to reach the target. This led to attempts like `(81 / (30 - 9))` or `(81 / (30 - (71 - 62)))`, where the focus shifted towards manipulating the numbers to create the necessary divisors or numerators.\n\nHowever, several calculations and assumptions were incorrect, leading to dead ends or requiring corrections. A pivotal moment came when the solver correctly identified `(81 - (71 - 62)) / 30 = 3`, which involved a careful adjustment of parentheses to ensure all numbers were used precisely once. After verifying the correct sequence and recalculating, the solver confirmed the validity of the equation `(81 - (71 - 62)) / 30`.\n\nIn summary, the solver's approach evolved from simple operations to more complex combinations, involving frequent revisions and adjustments until arriving at a successful equation that met the problem's requirements.\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution involved multiple strategies and backtracking as the solver struggled to find a valid equation using the numbers 81, 30, 71, and 62 to equal 3. Initially, the solver considered various combinations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, attempting to manipulate these numbers to reach the target value.\n\nOne key instance of changing strategy was when the solver realized that using division could potentially reduce larger numbers to smaller values, aiming to achieve the target of 3. This led to numerous attempts involving different operations and arrangements, such as (81 - 71) / (30 / (71 - 62)), which was close but did not yield exactly 3 due to rounding errors and the inability to use certain numbers more than once.\n\nAnother significant shift occurred when the solver recognized the need to form the denominator 27 to achieve 81/27 = 3. However, they were unable to construct 27 from the remaining numbers 30, 71, and 62 without reusing any numbers. This realization led to further attempts, including adjustments in the placement of parentheses and operations, but none of these adjustments produced the correct result.\n\nThroughout the process, the solver repeatedly encountered obstacles, such as needing a specific intermediate value (like 27) that couldn't be formed from the available numbers without violating the rule of using each number exactly once. Despite extensive trial and error, the solver remained unable to devise a combination that satisfied both the arithmetic requirements and the constraint of using each number exactly once.\n\nIn summary, the solver demonstrated persistence and flexibility in their approach but ultimately faced challenges in fulfilling the problem's conditions, leading to repeated backtracking and modification of initial strategies.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=27000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

The solver initially focused on combining the largest numbers (79 and 64) and then adjusting with the smaller numbers (5 and 45) using various arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. \n\nSeveral changes in strategy were observed:\n- Initially, the solver tried direct subtraction and addition but found the results were either too large or too small.\n- Next, they explored combinations involving multiplication and division but continued to miss the target of 48.\n- They then attempted to manipulate the numbers by creating fractions and decimals, but none of these combinations yielded the desired result.\n- The solver frequently recalculated expressions, such as (79 - 64) * (5 - (45 / something)), trying different values for 'something' to see if it could reach 48, but repeatedly found that the required intermediate values were not achievable with the available numbers.\n\nMultiple backtracks and reevaluations occurred as the solver realized their current approach wasn't working and switched tactics:\n- After failing with simple operations, the solver attempted more complex combinations and operations, such as nested parentheses and operations involving division of fractions, but these also did not yield the correct equation.\n- Throughout the process, the solver often returned to simpler combinations after realizing complex operations weren't leading to a solution, indicating a continuous reassessment of simpler approaches.\n\nDespite numerous attempts and strategic shifts, the solver concluded that they were unable to find a solution within the constraints provided. This realization prompted them to accept that further attempts might require a fresh perspective or additional insight into potentially overlooked combinations or operations.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct. If not, consider a different approach.\n<｜Assistant｜><think>\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=27000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.
