To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

I need to use all the numbers 49, 1, 96, and 72 exactly once each, with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses to make 36. Hmm. Alright, let's start by thinking about how these numbers can combine.\n\nFirst, I notice that 96 and 72 are both large numbers. Maybe subtracting them could help? Let me check. 96 - 72 is 24. Then I have 49 and 1 left. Hmm, 24 plus something? If I add 1, that's 25, then 49... not sure. Alternatively, maybe 96 divided by something? Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe find a way to get down to 36. Let's think of factors of 36. For example, 36 is 4*9, 6*6, 12*3, etc. Let me see if I can make any of these combinations.\n\nLooking at the numbers, 49 is a square number (7²), but not sure if that helps. Let's see. What if I subtract 49 - something? Let's try that. Suppose I do 49 - 1 = 48. Then maybe 96 and 72. If I take 96 - 72 = 24. Then 48 - 24 = 24. Not 36. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 72 divided by something. 72 divided by 2 is 36. Wait, how can I get 2 from the other numbers? Let's see. If I can make 2 from 49, 1, and 96. Let me think. For example, 96 divided by 48 is 2. But how to get 48? 49 -1 is 48. Oh! So here's an idea: 72 divided by ( (49 - 1) / 96 ) ? Wait, let me check that. Wait, 72 divided by ( (49 -1)/96 ) would be 72 * (96 / 48) = 72 * 2 = 144. That's way too big. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe if I do (something) divided by something else. Let me think again. Let's think of 72 - something equals 36. Then that something would be 36. So 72 - 36 = 36. How can I get 36 from 49, 1, 96? Let me see. Maybe 96 - 49 -1 = 46. No. 96 - (49 +1) = 46. Still not 36. Alternatively, 49 - (something) = 36. 49 - 13 = 36. How to get 13 from 96 and 1? 96 divided by something? 96 / 7.38... Not helpful. Maybe 96 - 1 = 95. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe combining 49 and 1 first. 49 +1 = 50. Then 96 and 72. Let's see, 96 - 72 = 24. Then 50 - 24 = 26. Not helpful. Or 96 / 72 = 1.333... Not helpful. 50 - (96 / 72) = 50 - 1.333... = 48.666... Not 36.\n\nWhat if I do 49 - (something) = 36. Then that something is 13. How to get 13 from 1, 96, 72? Let's see. 96 - 72 = 24. 24 - 1 = 23. No. 96 / something. 96 divided by 7.38... Not helpful. Maybe 72 divided by something. 72 / 5.538... No. Not helpful. Maybe 1 + something? 1 + (96 - 72) = 1 +24=25. Not 13. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe using multiplication and division. Let's think of fractions. For example, if I can do something like (96 / (something)) * (something else). Let's try. Suppose I take 96 divided by 49. That's roughly 1.959. Not helpful. How about 72 divided by something. 72 divided by 2 is 36. So if I can get 2 from 49, 1, and 96. Let me think. How to make 2 from 49, 1, 96? Maybe (96 - 49) - 1 = 46. No. Or (49 - 1) / 24? Wait, 49 -1 is 48. If I can divide that by 24, that would be 2. But how to get 24 from 96? Well, 96 divided by 4 is 24. But how to get 4? Not sure. Wait, but maybe I can do ( (49 - 1) / (96 / something) )? Let me think. Let's try to structure this.\n\nIf I want 72 divided by [something] equals 36. Then that something is 2. So 72 / 2 = 36. So how to get 2 from 49, 1, 96. Let's see. 96 divided by 48 is 2. How to get 48? 49 -1 = 48. Yes! So that would be 72 divided by (96 / (49 - 1)) = 72 / (96 / 48) = 72 / 2 = 36. So that uses 72, 96, 49, and 1. All numbers! Let me check:\n\nNumbers used: 72, 96, 49, 1. Yes. Each once. The operations are division and subtraction. So the equation would be 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) = 36. Let me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, 49 - 1 = 48. Then 96 divided by 48 is 2. Then 72 divided by 2 is 36. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the equation is 72 divided by (96 divided by (49 minus 1)). Which can be written as 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)).\n\nAlternatively, using parentheses properly: 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)).\n\nLet me check if that's the correct order. Yes, because division is left to right, but with parentheses, the denominator is calculated first. So yes.\n\nSo that uses all numbers once. Perfect. Therefore, the answer is that equation.\n\nSUMMARY:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

I need to use all the numbers 19, 60, 89, and 32 exactly once with any combination of the operations +, -, *, / and parentheses to make 20. Hmm, this might be tricky. Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nFirst, maybe I can look for ways to combine numbers to get closer to 20. Let me check the numbers again: 19 is close to 20, but how can I use the others? Let's see. If I can somehow subtract or divide the other numbers to get from 19 to 20. But I have to use all four numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe combining two numbers to make a larger number and then using others to adjust. Let me try different operations.\n\nLet me think about subtraction. For example, 89 minus something. Let's see: 89 - 60 is 29. Then maybe 32 - 19 is 13. But how to combine 29 and 13? Not sure. Maybe 29 - 13 = 16, not helpful.\n\nWhat if I do 60 - 32 = 28. Then 89 - 28 = 61. Then 61 - 19 = 42. Not helpful. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe division. Let's see. If I can divide some numbers to get smaller values. For example, 60 divided by something. Let's try 60 / (something). Suppose I take 60 divided by 32? That's about 1.875. Not sure. Maybe 89 divided by something?\n\nAlternatively, think about combining numbers to reach a target. Let's think of 20 as a result. Let's think of possible equations.\n\nWhat if I take 89 - 60 = 29. Then 32 - 19 = 13. Then 29 - 13 = 16. Still not 20. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 19 + something equals 20? Like 19 + 1 = 20. How to get 1 from 60, 89, 32? Let's see. For example, 89 - 60 - 32 = 89 - 92 = -3. Not helpful. Or 60 - (89 - 32) = 60 - 57 = 3. Then 19 + 3 = 22. Close, but not 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 32 - (something) = 1. Let's see. 32 - 31 = 1. How to get 31 from 60, 89, 19? 89 - 60 = 29, 29 + 19 = 48. No. 60 - 19 = 41. 89 - 41 = 48. Not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe multiplication and division. Let's see. Suppose I do 60 / (something) to get a useful number. For example, 60 / (something) equals maybe 5, then 5 * 4 = 20. Wait, but how to get 4 from other numbers?\n\nAlternatively, think of 89 - 60 - 32 = -3. Then 19 - (-3) = 22. Not helpful. Or maybe 19 - (something) = 20. That would require negative numbers. Like 19 - (-1) = 20. How to get -1 from 60, 89, 32? For example, (32 - 89) / 60 = (-57)/60 = -0.95. Not exactly -1. Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe combining 19 and 32 first. 19 + 32 = 51. Then 89 - 60 = 29. Then 51 - 29 = 22. Still not 20. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 60 - 32 = 28. Then 89 - 28 = 61. Then 61 - 19 = 42. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, 89 - 32 = 57. Then 60 - 19 = 41. Then 57 - 41 = 16. Still no.\n\nWait, maybe using division. Let's think. Suppose I take 60 divided by something. Let's see: 60 divided by (something) equals 20? Then that something would be 3. But how to get 3 from 19, 89, 32? Let's see. 89 - 32 = 57. 57 - 19 = 38. Not 3. Or 32 - 19 = 13. 89 - 13 = 76. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 89 divided by something. Let's see. 89 divided by (something) equals 20? That would require something around 4.45. Not sure. Maybe 89 divided by (something) plus something else equals 20.\n\nAlternatively, think of combining numbers in fractions. For example, (something) / (something else) + ... Let me try.\n\nWhat if I take 89 - 60 = 29. Then 32 - 19 = 13. Then 29 - 13 = 16. Not helpful. But if I can do 29 - (something) = 20. Then that something would be 9. How to get 9 from 32 and 19? 32 - 19 = 13. Not 9. 19 - 32 is negative. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe using multiplication. Let's see. Suppose I multiply two numbers and then subtract others. For example, 19 * something. 19 * 1 is 19, which is close. But how to get 1? Maybe (something)/(something else). Like (89 - 60 - 32) = -3. Then 19 + (-3) = 16. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's think of 20 as  (some number) * (some other number) divided by another. For example, 60 divided by 3 is 20. How to get 3 from 89, 32, 19? Let's see. 89 - 32 = 57. 57 divided by 19 is 3. Oh! That's interesting. So 60 divided by ( (89 - 32)/19 ) equals 60 divided by (57/19) = 60 divided by 3 = 20. Let me check that:\n\nCompute (89 - 32) = 57. Then divide by 19: 57 / 19 = 3. Then 60 divided by that is 60 / 3 = 20. Yes! And I used all numbers: 60, 89, 32, 19. Each exactly once. So the equation would be 60 / ((89 - 32)/19) = 20. Let me verify:\n\nFirst, compute the inner parentheses: 89 - 32 = 57. Then divide by 19: 57/19 = 3. Then 60 divided by 3 is 20. Correct. And all numbers used once. Perfect!\n\nSo the equation is 60 divided by ((89 minus 32) divided by 19). Which can be written as 60 / ((89 - 32)/19). Alternatively, using more parentheses for clarity: 60 / ( (89 - 32) / 19 ). That should be the answer.\n\nSUMMARY:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

The problem is to use all the numbers 49, 1, 96, and 72 exactly once with basic operations and parentheses to get 36. The previous attempt was (72 / (96 / (49 - 1))). Let me check if that works.\n\nFirst, calculate the innermost parentheses: 49 - 1 = 48. Then, 96 divided by 48 is 2. Then, 72 divided by 2 is 36. Oh, that actually works! So the answer is correct. But the user wants me to think step by step and show my reasoning. Let me go through it again carefully.\n\nStep 1: Use all numbers once. The equation uses 72, 96, 49, and 1. Check.\n\nStep 2: Operations allowed are +, -, *, /. The equation uses division and subtraction. Check.\n\nStep 3: Parentheses are used correctly to control order. The innermost is (49 - 1), then (96 / that result), then (72 / that result). Check.\n\nStep 4: Result is 36. As calculated, 49 - 1 = 48, 96 / 48 = 2, 72 / 2 = 36. Check.\n\nSo the answer is correct. But the user might want to see if there's another way, or if there's any mistake. Let me think of another approach just to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe combining numbers differently. For example, 96 - 72 = 24. Then 49 - 1 = 48. 24 and 48... Not sure. 24 * something? 24 * (something) = 36? That would be 1.5. Not sure.\n\nOr 72 - 96 = -24. Then 49 - 1 = 48. -24 + 48 = 24. Not 36.\n\nAnother way: 49 - 1 = 48. 96 / 48 = 2. 72 / 2 = 36. That's the same as the previous answer.\n\nSo it seems that the given answer is correct and there's no other obvious way. So the answer is correct.\n\nSUMMARY:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

Maybe I can subtract some numbers to get smaller values. Let me think about possible combinations.\n\nLet me try using division because 60 divided by something might get me closer to 20. If I divide 60 by 3, that's 20. How can I get 3 from the remaining numbers? The remaining numbers are 19, 89, and 32. Hmm, 89 - 32 is 57, and 57 - 19 is 38, not helpful. Maybe (89 - 32) / 19? Let me calculate that: 89 - 32 is 57, and 57 divided by 19 is 3. Oh! That gives me 3. So if I do 60 divided by ((89 - 32) / 19), that would be 60 divided by 3, which is 20. Let me check the order of operations with parentheses to make sure. Yes, the inner parentheses first: (89 - 32) = 57, then 57 / 19 = 3, then 60 / 3 = 20. That works! I used all the numbers once: 60, 89, 32, and 19. The operations are subtraction, division, and division again. I think that's the solution.\n\nSUMMARY:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.

We need to use the numbers 49, 1, 96, and 72 exactly once each, with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses to make an equation that equals 36.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the numbers and see if there are any obvious relationships or operations that might help. The numbers are 49, 1, 96, and 72. Let's think about combinations:\n\n- 96 and 72 are both multiples of 24. 96 is 4*24 and 72 is 3*24.\n- 49 is 7 squared.\n- 1 is a neutral number in multiplication and addition.\n\nMaybe we can use division or subtraction to reduce some of the larger numbers. Let's try combining 96 and 49 first. 96 - 49 = 47. That doesn't seem helpful.\n\nWhat about 49 - 1 = 48? That's interesting because 96 / 48 = 2, and 72 / 2 = 36. Wait, that seems promising!\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n(96 / (49 - 1)) = 96 / 48 = 2\n\nThen, 72 / 2 = 36\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) = 36\n\nLet me check that again:\n\n1. 49 - 1 = 48\n2. 96 / 48 = 2\n3. 72 / 2 = 36\n\nYes, that works.

The problem is to use all the numbers 19, 60, 89, and 32 exactly once with the operations +, -, *, / and parentheses to make 20. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the answer given in the previous attempt is correct. The answer was: 60 / ((89 - 32) / 19). Let's compute that.\n\nStart with the inner parentheses: 89 - 32 = 57. Then divide that by 19: 57 / 19 = 3. Then divide 60 by that result: 60 / 3 = 20. Oh, that actually works!

Since the answer given does work, it seems correct. However, I should check if there are other possible solutions as well, just to be thorough.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using subtraction or addition in a different way. Let's see:\n\nWhat if I try 89 - 60 = 29, and then 32 - 19 = 13. 29 - 13 = 16. Not 20. Hmm.\n\nHow about 60 - 32 = 28, 89 - 19 = 70. 28 - 70 = -42. Not helpful.\n\nWhat if I try multiplying some numbers? 19 * 32 = 608. That's way too big. 60 * 89 = 5340. Also too big.\n\nHow about division? Let's see: 89 / 19 ≈ 4.68. 60 / 32 ≈ 1.875. Not helpful.\n\nWait, the previous answer worked, so maybe that's the only solution. Let me just double-check that one again:\n\n60 / ((89 - 32) / 19) = 60 / (57 / 19) = 60 / 3 = 20. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer provided in the previous attempt is indeed correct.

We need to use the numbers [19, 60, 89, 32] exactly once each, and combine them with the operations +, -, *, / and parentheses to make the result equal to 20.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the numbers and think about how they might relate to 20. 60 is a multiple of 20 (3 times), so that might be useful. 89 is quite large, and 32 is also larger than 20, so maybe subtraction or division could help bring them down.\n\nLet me try a few combinations:\n\n1. Let's see if division can help. If I divide 60 by something to get 20, that something would need to be 3. Is there a way to get 3 from the other numbers? 89 - 32 = 57, and 57 divided by 19 is 3. So 60 divided by ( (89 - 32) / 19 ) would be 60 / 3 = 20. That seems to work!\n\nLet me check that again:\n- 89 - 32 = 57\n- 57 / 19 = 3\n- 60 / 3 = 20\n\nYes, that gives us 20 using all the numbers once. So the equation would be 60 / ((89 - 32) / 19) = 20.\n\nI should make sure I didn't miss any other possible combinations, but this one seems to fit all the rules.\n\nSUMMARY:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.6, top_p=0.95, top_k=20, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=5000, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=True, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: None, prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None.
