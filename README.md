# Project Overview: Improving Reasoning Models through Self-Summarization

We're working on a research project that aims to improve how AI reasoning models solve complex problems. Let me explain what the project is about and where we currently stand.

## The Research Problem

Modern AI reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 can solve complex math and logic problems by generating detailed step-by-step reasoning (often marked with `<think>` tags). However, we've identified an interesting gap: when these models make a single attempt at a problem (pass@1), they achieve about 70% accuracy on mathematical benchmarks like AIME. But if allowed multiple attempts (pass@64), accuracy jumps to about 85%.

Our research question: Can we close this gap without the computational expense of 64 separate attempts?

## The Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that models can improve their reasoning by doing something humans naturally do: summarizing their own work, reflecting on it, and using that reflection to guide further reasoning.

The key insight is that we could potentially achieve near pass@64 performance with significantly less computation by having the model:
1. Generate an initial reasoning trace
2. Summarize this reasoning
3. Use this summary to continue or redo its reasoning

## Project Structure

We've organized the project as a proper research codebase with:

- Core modules for working with reasoning models, generating reasoning traces, creating summaries, and evaluating results
- Configurable pipelines for different experimental approaches
- Testing infrastructure to validate each component
- Experiment runners for systematic evaluation
- Clear separation of data, code, and results

## Pipeline Flow

The basic flow of our approach is:

1. Generate initial reasoning trace from model
2. Extract and check answer for correctness
3. For incorrect answers:
   - Summarize the reasoning trace (either using the same model or GPT-4o)
   - Generate new reasoning based on the summary
   - Extract new answer and check if it's improved

## Current Status

We've completed the repository structure design and are about to start implementing the core components in an iterative, test-driven way. Our plan is to build up from fundamental utilities (configuration, logging) to the complete pipeline, testing each component as we go.

## Research Goals

If successful, this project could:
1. Demonstrate a novel approach for improving reasoning model performance through reflection
2. Create a more computationally efficient way to get high-quality reasoning
3. Potentially lead to a paper at venues like NeurIPS or ICLR, especially if we develop the "summarize tag" approach
4. Provide insights into how large language models can benefit from reviewing and reflecting on their own reasoning

The project leverages existing state-of-the-art models while introducing a novel framework for enhancing their capabilities through a systematic approach to self-improvement.
