2024-I-8,"Eight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.","Draw an altitude from both end circles of the diagram with the circles of radius one, and call the lengths you get drawing the altitudes of the circles down to $BC$ $a$ and $b$. Now we have the length of side $BC$ of being $(2)(2022)+1+1+a+b$. However, the side $BC$ can also be written as $(6)(68)+34+34+34a+34b$, due to similar triangles from the second diagram. If we set the equations equal, we have $\frac{1190}{11} = a+b$. Call the radius of the incircle $r$, then we have the side BC to be $r(a+b)$. We find $r$ as $\frac{4046+\frac{1190}{11}}{\frac{1190}{11}}$, which simplifies to $\frac{10+((34)(11))}{10}$, so we have $\frac{192}{5}$, which sums to $\boxed{197}$.",197
2024-I-12,Define $f(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{2}|$ and $g(x)=|| x|-\tfrac{1}{4}|$. Find the number of intersections of the graphs of \[y=4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad\text{ and }\quad x=4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))).\],"We will denote $h(x)=4g(f(x))$ for simplicity. Denote $p(x)$ as the first equation and $q(y)$ as the graph of the second. We notice that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ oscillate between 0 and 1. The intersections are thus all in the square $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$. Every $p(x)$ wave going up and down crosses every $q(y)$ wave. Now, we need to find the number of times each wave touches 0 and 1.

We notice that $h(x)=0$ occurs at $x=-\frac{3}{4}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}$, and $h(x)=1$ occurs at $x=-1, -\frac{1}{2}, 0,\frac{1}{2},1$. A sinusoid passes through each point twice during each period, but it only passes through the extrema once. $p(x)$ has 1 period between 0 and 1, giving 8 solutions for $p(x)=0$ and 9 solutions for $p(x)=1$, or 16 up and down waves. $q(y)$ has 1.5 periods, giving 12 solutions for $q(y)=0$ and 13 solutions for $q(y)=1$, or 24 up and down waves. This amounts to $16\cdot24=384$ intersections.

However, we have to be very careful when counting around $(1, 1)$. At this point, $q(y)$ has an infinite downwards slope and $p(x)$ is slanted, giving us an extra intersection; thus, we need to add 1 to our answer to get $\boxed{385}$.",385
