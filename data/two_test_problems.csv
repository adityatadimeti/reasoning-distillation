TEST-001,"A box contains 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 5 green balls. If 3 balls are randomly selected without replacement, what is the probability that all 3 balls are the same color?","I need to find the probability of drawing 3 balls of the same color out of 12 balls total.

Total number of ways to select 3 balls from 12 balls = $\binom{12}{3} = \frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = \frac{12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 220$

Number of ways to select 3 red balls from 4 red balls = $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
Number of ways to select 3 blue balls from 3 blue balls = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
Number of ways to select 3 green balls from 5 green balls = $\binom{5}{3} = 10$

Total number of ways to select 3 balls of the same color = 4 + 1 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the probability is $\frac{15}{220} = \frac{3}{44}$

The answer is 47 (3+44).",47
TEST-002,"A train travels from City A to City B at a constant speed of 60 mph. Another train leaves City B for City A, along the same track, 30 minutes after the first train leaves City A. The trains meet 90 miles from City A. If the second train travels at a constant speed of 40 mph, what is the distance in miles between City A and City B?","Let's say the distance between City A and City B is d miles.

Train 1 leaves City A at time t = 0, traveling at 60 mph.
Train 2 leaves City B at time t = 0.5 hours, traveling at 40 mph.

The trains meet 90 miles from City A. At that point, Train 1 has traveled 90 miles, and Train 2 has traveled (d - 90) miles.

Let's say they meet t hours after Train 1 leaves City A. Then:
- Train 1's distance: 60t = 90
- Train 2's distance: 40(t - 0.5) = d - 90

From the first equation: t = 90/60 = 1.5 hours

Substituting into the second equation:
40(1.5 - 0.5) = d - 90
40(1) = d - 90
40 = d - 90
d = 130

The distance between City A and City B is 130 miles.",130
