2024-II-4,"Let $x,y$ and $z$ be positive real numbers that satisfy the following system of equations: 
\[\log_2\left({x \over yz}\right) = {1 \over 2}\]
\[\log_2\left({y \over xz}\right) = {1 \over 3}\]
\[\log_2\left({z \over xy}\right) = {1 \over 4}\]
Then the value of $\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.","Denote $\log_2(x) = a$, $\log_2(y) = b$, and $\log_2(z) = c$.

Then, we have:
$a-b-c = \frac{1}{2}$,
$-a+b-c = \frac{1}{3}$,
$-a-b+c = \frac{1}{4}$.

Now, we can solve to get $a = \frac{-7}{24}, b = \frac{-9}{24}, c = \frac{-5}{12}$.
Plugging these values in, we obtain $|4a + 3b + 2c|  = \frac{25}{8} \implies \boxed{033}$.",33
2024-II-12,"Let $O(0,0), A(\tfrac{1}{2}, 0),$ and $B(0, \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2})$ be points in the coordinate plane. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ of unit length lying in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. There is a unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$, distinct from $A$ and $B$, that does not belong to any segment from $\mathcal{F}$ other than $\overline{AB}$. Then $OC^2 = \tfrac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.","Begin by finding the equation of the line $\overline{AB}$: $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Now, consider the general equation of all lines that belong to $\mathcal{F}$. Let $P$ be located at $(a, 0)$ and $Q$ be located at $(0, b)$. With these assumptions, we may arrive at the equation $ay + bx = ab$. However, a critical condition that must be satisfied by our parameters is that $a^2 + b^2 = 1$, since the length of $\overline{PQ} = 1$. We wish to find a point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$ such that $\overline{PQ}$ passes through $C$ if and only if $a = \frac{1}{2}$. Since the property $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ implies that if $a = \frac{1}{2}$, then $\overline{PQ} = \overline{AB}$, we now proceed by finding the intersection of two lines: 

a(-\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) + x\sqrt{1-a^2} = a\sqrt{1-a^2}.
After algebraic manipulations, we arrive at the equation: 
-a^4 + 2xa^3 + (-4x^2 + 3x + \frac{1}{4})a^2 - 2xa + x^2 = 0.
Note that $a = \frac{1}{2}$ is a solution to this polynomial. Perform polynomial division to eliminate the extraneous solution $a = \frac{1}{2}$. This yields: 
-a^3 + (2x - \frac{1}{2})a^2 + (-4x^2 + 4x)a - 2x^2 = 0.
We then plug in $a = \frac{1}{2}$ to find the corresponding values of $x$. This results in the quadratic equation: 
16x^2 - 10x + 1 = 0.
This is easily factored to give $x = \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{2}$. Since $x = \frac{1}{2}$ corresponds to a point already covered by the horizontal line segment, we discard it. Thus, $x = \frac{1}{8}$ is the only valid solution.
Now, we substitute $x = \frac{1}{8}$ into the equation of line $\overline{AB}$: $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which gives $y = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}$.
The distance from the origin is then given by $\sqrt{\frac{1}{8^2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{7}{16}}$. Squaring this distance gives $\frac{7}{16}$, so the answer is $\boxed{23}$.",23
