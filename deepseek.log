To run the model in eager mode, set 'enforce_eager=True' or use '--enforce-eager' in the CLI. If out-of-memory error occurs during cudagraph capture, consider decreasing `gpu_memory_utilization` or switching to eager mode. You can also reduce the `max_num_seqs` as needed to decrease memory usage.

After exploring various combinations, the solver realizes that dividing 96 by (49 - 1) yields 2. This simplifies to 96 / 48 = 2 since 49 - 1 = 48. Multiplying this result by the inverse operation, the solver divides 72 by 2 to achieve the target number of 36. Thus, the equation derived is 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) = 36. This solution uses all the required numbers and adheres to the specified operations and rules, ensuring the correct order of operations with parentheses.\n\nFinal Answer: <answer>72 / (96 / (49 - 1))</answer>\n\nATTEMPT 1 SUMMARY:\nThe attempted solution carefully explores various combinations of the numbers 49, 1, 96, and 72 using arithmetic operations to achieve the target value of 36. After numerous trials involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the solver found a valid equation: \n\n\\[ 72 / \\left(96 / (49 - 1)\\right) = 36 \\]\n\nThis solution leverages the operation sequence to simplify the expression correctly:\n\n1. Calculate the innermost parentheses: \\(49 - 1 = 48\\).\n2. Next, perform the division inside the parentheses: \\(96 / 48 = 2\\).\n3. Finally, divide 72 by the result of the previous step: \\(72 / 2 = 36\\).\n\nThe solver also considered alternative approaches such as combining the numbers through addition and subtraction but concluded that the division-based method was the most effective. Other attempts included multiplying and adding/subtracting the numbers in different orders, but none yielded the target value of 36 without deviating from the core solution.\n\nAfter thorough examination, the solver determined that the equation \\(72 / \\left(96 / (49 - 1)\\right)\\) is the correct and simplest way to achieve the desired outcome.\n\nFinal answer in requested format: \n<answer> 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) </answer>\n\nATTEMPT 2 SUMMARY:\nThe summary of the attempted solution is as follows:\n\nThe problem required constructing an equation using the numbers 49, 1, 96, and 72 to equal 36, adhering to specific arithmetic operations and ensuring each number is used exactly once. Initially, the solution 72 / (96 / (49 - 1)) = 36 was provided and verified to be correct through step-by-step calculation.\n\nThe solver then explored various combinations and operations to find alternative solutions, considering addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in different orders and groupings. Some of the approaches included:\n\n- Directly manipulating 96 and 49 to get intermediate values like 48 and then using these with 72.\n- Considering multiplication and division between the numbers to find useful intermediate results.\n- Attempting to combine 72 and 96 in different ways to simplify the equation.\n\nAfter thorough exploration, another valid equation was discovered: (72 / 96) * (49 - 1) = 36, which was confirmed to be correct by breaking it down step-by-step. This equation provides an alternative method to reach the target number while adhering to the problem's constraints.\n\nIn conclusion, the solver verified the initial solution and found an additional valid equation, demonstrating that multiple paths can lead to the desired outcome. Both solutions are correct and valid under the problem's rules.\n\nBased on your previous solution attempts, evaluate whether the most recent approach and answer are correct.
